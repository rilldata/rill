# Multi-Panel Dialog Tabs

This directory contains special-purpose tabs used for multi-panel, multi-step dialogs.

## Unique Features
These tabs are unique in that they:
- Have a fixed height & width
- Include a number next to each tab
- Are not clickable

## Implementation Details

The components in this directory are heavily adapted from ShadCN Svelte's tab component set. The `disabled` prop is applied to create non-clickable tabs. The aesthetics of the ShadCN disabled tabs have been significantly altered.
