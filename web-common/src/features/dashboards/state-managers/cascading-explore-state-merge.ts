/**
 * Performs a cascading merge of provided explore states in order.
 * Applies a shallow merge for all keys except those in ShallowMergeOneLevelDeepKeys.
 * Keys in ShallowMergeOneLevelDeepKeys are shallow merged at their own level.
 *
 * Most state values are literals, so shallow/deep merging makes no difference for them.
 * Non-literal values like filters, visible measures/dimensions should come entirely from a single source.
 * For example: We cannot have a publisher filter from one source and a domain filter from another source.
 * These should come from the first source that contains filters.
 *
 * The exception is keys in ShallowMergeOneLevelDeepKeys which need to be shallow merged separately at their level.
 * This is necessary because these state values contain nested properties one level deep.
 * For example: selectedTimeRange contains both selected time range and grain.
 * tdd and pivot have their respective values underneath those keys.
 *
 * This would be avoided if each subsection of the state have their own classes.
 * Then we could offload the specific merging logic to the class methods.
