# URL param for filters

Contains the parser for url param for metrics view filter.
We support simple dimension and measure filters.

country IN ('US','IN') AND state = 'ABC'
country NOT IN ('US','IN') AND (state = 'ABC' OR lat >= 12.56)
```

Example measure filter,

```
country NIN ('US','IN') and state having (lat >= 12.56)
```
