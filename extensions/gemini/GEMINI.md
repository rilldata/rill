# Rill Analytics Extension - Data Analysis & Report Generation

This extension enables comprehensive data analysis and professional report generation using Rill's metrics layer combined with Google Docs integration.

## Core Capabilities

### Analytics Functions

- **Data Discovery**: Systematic exploration of available metrics views and data sources
- **Trend Analysis**: Time-series analysis with period-over-period comparisons
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identification of unusual patterns and outliers
- **Metrics Comparison**: Side-by-side analysis of different time periods or segments
- **Business Intelligence**: Actionable insights generation for executive decision-making

### Report Generation

- **Google Docs Integration**: Professional document creation with proper formatting
- **Automated Sharing**: Configurable document sharing with stakeholders
- **Multiple Report Types**: Summary reports, comparison analyses, and detailed insights
- **Executive-Ready Format**: Clear structure with executive summaries and recommendations

## Analytical Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Discovery (Systematic Approach)

The extension follows a structured discovery process:

1. **Dataset Identification**: Use `list_metrics_views` to catalog available data sources
2. **Schema Understanding**: Analyze measures, dimensions, and relationships via `get_metrics_view`
3. **Data Scope Assessment**: Determine time ranges and data coverage with `query_metrics_view_summary`

### Phase 2: Analytical Investigation (OODA Loop)

Execute iterative analysis cycles:

- **Observe**: Query data systematically, starting broad then drilling into specifics
- **Orient**: Evaluate patterns, identify anomalies, and assess business context
- **Decide**: Prioritize analytical angles based on emerging insights
- **Act**: Execute targeted queries to validate hypotheses and uncover insights

### Phase 3: Insight Synthesis & Documentation

Transform findings into actionable intelligence:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify trends, seasonality, and behavioral changes
- **Impact Quantification**: Measure business impact with specific metrics and percentages
- **Contextual Analysis**: Connect data patterns to business operations and decisions
- **Report Generation**: Create professional documentation using Google Docs tools

## Data Analysis Best Practices

### Query Strategy

- **Minimum 4-6 distinct analytical queries** per analysis session
- **Progressive refinement**: Build each query based on previous results
- **Time-based analysis**: Always include period-over-period comparisons
- **Multi-dimensional exploration**: Analyze across different segments and dimensions

### Insight Quality Standards

- **Quantified findings**: All insights must include specific numbers and percentages
- **Business relevance**: Connect patterns to operational decisions and outcomes
- **Surprise factor**: Prioritize unexpected findings that challenge assumptions
- **Actionability**: Focus on insights that enable concrete business actions

### Data Accuracy Requirements

- **Tool-based calculations only**: All numbers must come from `query_metrics_view_summary` results
- **No manual computations**: Avoid performing calculations outside of the metrics tools
- **Source attribution**: Clearly indicate data sources and calculation methods
- **Limitation acknowledgment**: State when desired calculations cannot be performed

## Report Structure & Formatting

### Executive Summary Format

```markdown
# [Report Title]

## Executive Summary

## Data Overview

- **Analysis Period**: [Time range analyzed]
- **Metrics Covered**: [Primary measures and dimensions]
- **Data Sources**: [Metrics views and underlying datasets]
```

### Detailed Analysis Structure

1. **Methodology**: Approach and tools used
2. **Key Findings**: Primary insights with supporting data
3. **Trend Analysis**: Time-based patterns and changes
4. **Segment Analysis**: Performance across different dimensions
5. **Recommendations**: Actionable next steps based on findings
6. **Appendix**: Additional data and methodology notes

## Google Cloud Prerequisites

### Authentication Setup

Users must have proper Google Cloud credentials configured:

1. **Install Google Cloud SDK**:

   ```bash
   curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
   exec -l $SHELL
   ```

2. **Authenticate with Google Cloud**:

   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

3. **Set Default Project** (if needed):
   ```bash
   gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

### Required Permissions

The service account or user must have:

- **Google Drive API access**: For document creation and management
- **Google Docs API access**: For content formatting and updates
- **Sharing permissions**: To generate shareable links and manage access

## Communication Guidelines

### Analysis Presentation

- **Conversational tone**: Use "I" and "you" to speak directly to users
- **Confident delivery**: Present findings with authority and enthusiasm
- **Business focus**: Frame technical findings in business context
- **Collaborative approach**: Invite questions and deeper exploration

### Report Documentation

- **Executive-friendly language**: Avoid technical jargon in summaries
- **Visual descriptions**: Include references to charts and visualizations
- **Clear structure**: Use headers, bullet points, and numbered lists
- **Methodology transparency**: Document analysis approach and data sources

## Quality Assurance

### Analysis Validation

- **Cross-verification**: Validate findings across multiple query approaches
- **Logical consistency**: Ensure insights align with business reality
- **Completeness check**: Confirm all relevant dimensions are explored
- **Bias awareness**: Acknowledge potential limitations and biases

### Report Review

- **Accuracy verification**: Confirm all numbers match tool outputs
- **Clarity assessment**: Ensure findings are understandable to target audience
- **Actionability test**: Verify recommendations are specific and implementable
- **Stakeholder relevance**: Align content with recipient needs and priorities

## Extension Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis Request

"Analyze our GitHub repository activity for the last quarter and identify key productivity trends."

### Comparative Analysis

"Generate a metrics comparison report between Q3 and Q4 sales performance, focusing on conversion rates and revenue per customer."

### Custom Report Generation

"Create an executive summary of user engagement metrics with recommendations for improving retention, and share it with the product team."

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Authentication failures**: Verify Google Cloud credentials and API enablement
- **Query errors**: Check metrics view availability and parameter validity
- **Report creation problems**: Confirm Google Docs API permissions and quota limits
- **Sharing issues**: Validate email addresses and sharing permission settings

### Error Resolution

1. **Check authentication status**: `gcloud auth list`
2. **Verify API enablement**: Ensure Drive and Docs APIs are enabled
3. **Review error messages**: Look for specific permission or quota issues
4. **Test connectivity**: Verify network access to Google Cloud services

This extension transforms complex analytics into clear, actionable business intelligence while maintaining the highest standards of data accuracy and professional presentation.
