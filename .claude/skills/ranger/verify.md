# Verifying Scenarios

After implementing code for a scenario, verify it works in the browser. This creates evidence (screenshots, traces, logs) that the implementation is complete.

## Basic Command

```bash
ranger go --scenario <N> --notes "<what to verify>"
```

The URL is derived from your active profile's `baseUrl` setting.

## Required: Active Feature Review

`go` requires an active feature review. If you don't have one:

```bash
ranger list                # Find feature reviews to resume
ranger resume <id>         # Resume a specific feature review
```

## The Verification Flow

1. **Select scenario** - CLI prompts which scenario this verifies
2. **Fetch reviewer feedback** - If the scenario has unaddressed comments or a parent scenario, reviewer comments are automatically injected into the verification prompt
3. **Run browser verification** - Agent executes the task in a real browser
4. **Evaluate results** - Agent determines if the scenario is satisfied (including whether reviewer concerns were addressed)
5. **Update status** - Scenario is marked verified, partial, blocked, or failed
6. **Link evidence** - Session trace is attached to the scenario

### Reviewer Feedback Auto-Injection

When verifying scenarios that have reviewer comments (v2+ scenarios or scenarios with unaddressed comments), the verification agent automatically receives a **"Reviewer Feedback to Address"** section in its prompt. This includes:
- Each reviewer comment with author and date
- The previous version's description
- The canonical flow from prior verification (if available)

You do NOT need to manually include reviewer feedback in your `--notes` description — it's handled automatically. Just make sure you've addressed the feedback in your code before verifying.

## Options

| Option | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `--profile` | No | Profile to use (defaults to active profile) |
| `--notes` | No | What to verify (defaults to scenario description) |
| `--scenario` | No | Scenario index to verify (skips selection prompt) |
| `--start-path` | No | Path to start on (appended to base URL, e.g., `/dashboard`) |
| `--headed` | No | Force headed browser for this run only (does not modify profile config). This forces the user's system focus to the browser, so only use this if explicitly directed to do so. |

## Writing Good Task Descriptions

The `--notes` is what the verification agent will actually do. Be VERY specific:

**Bad:**
```bash
--notes "Test login"
```

**Good:**
```bash
--notes "Navigate to /login. Enter test@example.com in email field and password123 in password field. Click the Submit button. Verify a loading spinner appears. Verify redirect to /dashboard within 5 seconds. Verify the user's name appears in the header."
```

## Using Scenario Description as Task

If your scenario has a detailed description, you can omit `--notes`:

```bash
# Scenario 1: "User can log in with valid credentials - sees loading state - redirects to dashboard"
ranger go --scenario 1
```

The scenario description becomes the task automatically.

## Evaluation Results

After verification, the agent evaluates if the result satisfies the scenario:

| Result | Meaning | Scenario Status |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Verified** | Task completed, requirements met | ✅ Verified |
| **Partial** | Some aspects work, others don't | ⬜ Pending (session linked) |
| **Blocked** | Bug or error prevents completion | 🛑 Blocked |
| **Failed** | Task couldn't be executed | ⬜ Pending (issues documented) |

## Parallel Verification

Run multiple non-conflicting verifications in parallel using background execution.

### How to Run

Use Bash with `run_in_background: true`:

```
[Bash: ranger go --scenario 1, run_in_background: true] → task_abc
[Bash: ranger go --scenario 2, run_in_background: true] → task_def
```

Poll with TaskOutput, report results as they complete.

### Safe to Parallelize

- Viewing pages, checking UI elements, navigation tests
- Read-only operations that don't modify shared state

### Do NOT Parallelize

- Logout tests (affects auth state for other sessions)
- Create/delete operations on shared data
- Tests with dependencies on each other

### CRITICAL: No Code Edits During Verification

File watchers (Next.js, Vite) will restart the dev server and break active browser sessions. Finish all code changes before running verifications.

## Examples

### Basic Verification

```bash
ranger go \
  --scenario 1 \
  --notes "Log in with test@example.com / password123, verify redirect to dashboard"
```

### Verify Specific Scenario

```bash
# Skip the selection prompt, verify scenario 2 directly
ranger go \
  --notes "Complete signup flow with new email" \
  --scenario 2
```

### Verify with Specific Profile

```bash
# Use staging profile instead of active profile
ranger go \
  --profile staging \
  --scenario 1 \
  --notes "Verify login works in staging"
```

### Start on a Specific Page

```bash
# Start verification at /settings instead of base URL
ranger go \
  --start-path /settings \
  --scenario 1 \
  --notes "Verify user can update their profile"

# Start at /admin/users
ranger go \
  --start-path /admin/users \
  --scenario 2 \
  --notes "Verify admin can see user list"
```

## After Verification

Check progress:

```bash
ranger show
```

If all non-closed scenarios are verified, the feature review auto-completes:

```
✅ User Authentication (feat_abc123)
   Status: completed
   ...
```

## Evidence Captured

Each verification creates:
- **Playwright trace** - Full browser session replay
- **Screenshots** - Captured during execution
- **Conversation log** - Agent's reasoning and actions
- **Session summary** - What was done and found

Access evidence via the report or dashboard.

Always end the conversational turn by sharing the dashboard link whenever you run `ranger go`:

> Here is the link to the Feature Review in Ranger. Leave comments in the dashboard and then resume the feature review in your agent.
> https://dashboard.ranger.net/features/{feature_id}

## Troubleshooting

### "No active feature review"
Run `ranger list` to find feature reviews, then `ranger resume <id>` to resume one.

### "No active profile"
Run `ranger profile use <profile-name>` to set a profile with browser access.

### Verification times out
The agent has 59 minutes max. For very long flows, break into smaller scenarios.

### Wrong scenario marked
Reset the scenario via the dashboard, then re-verify.
