description: Interview user in-depth to create a detailed spec
allowed-tools: AskUserQuestion, Write
---

Follow the user instructions and interview me in detail using the `AskUserQuestion` tool about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious. Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete. Then, write the spec to a file using the `Write` tool.
