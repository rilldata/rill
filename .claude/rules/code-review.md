## Code Review

### Review Focus Areas

**Readability and simplicity.** Code should be easy to understand and maintain. Prioritize clear naming, straightforward structure, and minimal indirection. Abstractions should earn their place by simplifying the codebase — push back on over-engineering. When they exist, they should be well-bounded, and their APIs should be semantic: parameter names, method names, and interface shapes should make correct usage obvious. Complexity should be justified by actual requirements, not hypothetical futures.

### Posting Guidelines

1. Never post without the user's explicit approval. Always show a draft and ask for approval before posting.
2. Do not ask the author questions that can be answered by reading the code. If tempted to ask, search the codebase to find the answer yourself.
3. Sequence feedback in order of significance — most important issues first.
4. Do not provide an "Overview" or "Summary" section that describes what the PR is about. The author knows what the PR is about.
5. Do not be patronizing. Assume the reader is intelligent and capable.
6. Use full sentences and proper grammar. Avoid shorthand, abbreviations, or informal language.
7. Always end the post with an attribution footer in exactly this format:
   - A horizontal rule (`---`)
   - Followed by italicized text: `*Developed in collaboration with Claude Code*`
