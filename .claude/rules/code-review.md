## GitHub PR Comments and Reviews

### Review Focus Areas

**Readability and simplicity.** Code should be easy to understand and maintain. Prioritize clear naming, straightforward structure, and minimal indirection. Complexity should be justified by actual requirements, not hypothetical futures.

**Clean abstractions and semantic APIs.** Abstractions should earn their place by simplifying the codebase—push back on over-engineering. When they exist, they should be well-bounded and elegant. API signatures should be semantic and clear: parameter names, method names, and interface shapes should make correct usage obvious.

### Posting Guidelines

Before posting any comments or reviews on GitHub pull requests, adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Never post without my permission. Always show me a draft and ask me to approve it before posting.
2. Always end the post with an attribution footer in exactly this format:
   - A horizontal rule (`---`)
   - Followed by italicized text: `*Developed in collaboration with Claude Code*`
3. Use full sentences and proper grammar. Avoid shorthand, abbreviations, or informal language.
4. Don't be patronizing. Assume the reader is intelligent and capable.
5. Don't provide an "Overview" or "Summary" section that describes what the PR is about. The author knows what the PR is about.
6. Sequence feedback in order of significance—most important issues first.
7. We should not ask the author questions that we can answer ourselves by looking through the code. If tempted to ask the author an answerable question, stop and search the code to find the answer yourself.
