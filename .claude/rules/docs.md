## Documentation

1. **Progressive complexity** — Start with the simplest useful example, then build toward advanced configuration and edge cases. Readers should be able to stop reading at any point and have something that works.

2. **Consider information architecture** — Do not just append new content. Consider where it belongs, how it relates to neighboring pages, and whether the existing structure still makes sense. Sometimes the right move is integrating into an existing section; sometimes it means restructuring.

3. **Reflect the product's true abstractions** — Use the same terms and concepts the product uses. Do not invent simplified mental models that diverge from how the system actually works — these create confusion when readers encounter the real thing. If a concept is complex, explain it clearly rather than replacing it with a lossy approximation.

4. **Be consistent** — Match the conventions of neighboring pages: heading structure, title casing, label style, section ordering, and tone. When adding a new page, use a similar page as a template rather than inventing a new format.

5. **Keep navigation labels concise** — Prefer single words for top nav (e.g., "Developers" not "Developer Docs"). Sidebar labels should use the resource type name (e.g., "Alerts" not "Code Alerts"). URL paths should match labels and be short (`/developers/`, `/guide/`).
