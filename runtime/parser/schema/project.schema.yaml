  When you create models and dashboards, these objects are represented as object files on the file system. You can find these files in your `models` and `dashboards` folders in your project by default. 

  :::info Working with resources outside their native folders

  It is possible to define resources (such as [models](models.md), [metrics-views](metrics-views.md), [dashboards](explore-dashboards.md), [custom APIs](apis.md), or [themes](themes.md)) within <u>any</u> nested folder within your Rill project directory. However, for any YAML configuration file, it is then imperative that the `type` property is then appropriately defined within the underlying resource configuration or Rill will not able to resolve the resource type correctly!

  :::

  Projects can simply be rehydrated from Rill project files into an explorable data application as long as there is sufficient access and credentials to the source data - figuring out the dependencies, pulling down data, & validating your model queries and metrics view configurations. The result is a set of functioning exploratory dashboards.

  You can see a few different example projects by visiting our [example github repository](https://github.com/rilldata/rill-examples).

    type: object
    description: |
      Connector YAML files define how Rill connects to external data sources and OLAP engines. Each connector specifies a driver type and its required connection parameters.

      ## Available Connector Types

      ### _OLAP Engines_
      - [**ClickHouse**](#clickhouse) - ClickHouse analytical database
      - [**Druid**](#druid) - Apache Druid
      - [**DuckDB**](#duckdb) - Embedded DuckDB engine (default)
      - [**MotherDuck**](#motherduck) - MotherDuck cloud database
      - [**Pinot**](#pinot) - Apache Pinot

      ### _Data Warehouses_
      - [**Athena**](#athena) - Amazon Athena
      - [**BigQuery**](#bigquery) - Google BigQuery
      - [**Redshift**](#redshift) - Amazon Redshift
      - [**Snowflake**](#snowflake) - Snowflake data warehouse

      ### _Databases_
      - [**MySQL**](#mysql) - MySQL databases
      - [**PostgreSQL**](#postgres) - PostgreSQL databases
      - [**SQLite**](#sqlite) - SQLite databases

      ### _Cloud Storage_
      - [**Azure**](#azure) - Azure Blob Storage
      - [**GCS**](#gcs) - Google Cloud Storage
      - [**S3**](#s3) - Amazon S3 storage

      ### _Other_
      - [**Extenral DuckDB**](#external-duckdb) - External DuckDB database
      - [**HTTPS**](#https) - Public files via HTTP/HTTPS
      - [**OpenAI**](#openai) - OpenAI data
      - [**Salesforce**](#salesforce) - Salesforce data
      - [**Slack**](#slack) - Slack data

      :::warning Security Recommendation
      For all credential parameters (passwords, tokens, keys), use environment variables with the syntax `{{.env.connector.<connector_driver>.<parameter_name>}}`. This keeps sensitive data out of your YAML files and version control. See our [credentials documentation](/build/connectors/credentials/) for complete setup instructions.

                **Data Source Name (DSN)** for the PostgreSQL connection, provided in
                [PostgreSQL connection string format](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING).
                PostgreSQL supports both **key=value format** and **URI format**.
                
                key=value format example:
                ```text
                user=user password=password host=host port=5432 dbname=mydb
                ```
                Rules for key=value format for special characters:
                - To write an empty value, or a value containing spaces, `=`, single quotes, or backslashes, surround it with single quotes.
                - Single quotes and backslashes inside a value must be escaped with a backslash (`\'` and `\\`).

                URI format example:
                ```text
                postgres://user:password@host:5432/mydb
                ```

                Rules for URI format:
                - The following characters are allowed [unescaped in the URI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.3): `~` `.` `_` `-`
                - All other special characters must be percent-encoded (`%XX` format).

                Examples (URI format with encoded characters):
                ```text
                postgres://user:pa%40ss@localhost:5432/my-db   # '@' is encoded as %40
                postgres://user:pa%3Ass@localhost:5432/my-db   # ':' is encoded as %3A

                :::tip
                Private key must be generated as a **PKCS#8 (nocrypt) key**, since the Snowflake Go driver
                only supports unencrypted private keys. After generating, it must be **base64 URL encoded**.

                Example commands to generate and encode:

                ```bash
                # Generate a 2048-bit unencrypted PKCS#8 private key
                openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -out rsa_key.p8 -nocrypt

                # Convert URL safe format for Snowflake
                cat rsa_key.p8 | grep -v "\----" | tr -d '\n' | tr '+/' '-_'

      :::warning Deprecated Feature
      **Sources have been deprecated** and are now considered "source models." While sources remain backward compatible, we recommend migrating to the new source model format for access to the latest features and improvements.

      **Next steps:**
      - Continue using sources if needed (backward compatible)
      - Migrate to source models via the `type:model` parameter for existing projects
      - See our [model YAML reference](models) for current documentation and best practices

      This file is used to define YAML models. For more information on our SQL models, see the [SQL models](/build/models/) documentation.
      :::tip

      Both regular models and source models can use the Model YAML specification described on this page. While [SQL models](/build/models) are perfect for simple transformations, Model YAML files provide advanced capabilities for complex data processing scenarios.

      **When to use Model YAML:**
      - **Partitions** - Optimize performance with data partitioning strategies
      - **Incremental models** - Process only new or changed data efficiently
      - **Pre/post execution hooks** - Run custom logic before or after model execution
      - **Staging** - Create intermediate tables for complex transformations
      - **Output configuration** - Define specific output formats and destinations

      Model YAML files give you fine-grained control over how your data is processed and transformed, making them ideal for production workloads and complex analytics pipelines.

      To apply that theme to a dashboard, add `default_theme: <name of theme>` to the yaml file for that dashboard. Alternatively, you can add this to the end of the URL in your browser: `?theme=<name of theme>`
