  - title: Project-wide defaults
    type: object
    description: |
      In `rill.yaml`, project-wide defaults can be specified for a resource type within a project. Unless otherwise specified, _individual resources will inherit any defaults_ that have been specified in `rill.yaml`. For available properties that can be configured, please refer to the YAML specification for each individual resource type - [model](models.md), [metrics_view](metrics-views.md), and [explore](explore-dashboards.md)

      :::note Use plurals when specifying project-wide defaults
      In your `rill.yaml`, the top level property for the resource type needs to be **plural**, such as `models`, `metrics_views` and `explores`.
      :::

      :::info Hierarchy of inheritance and property overrides
      As a general rule of thumb, properties that have been specified at a more _granular_ level will supercede or override higher level properties that have been inherited. Therefore, in order of inheritance, Rill will prioritize properties in the following order:
      1. Individual [models](models.md)/[metrics_views](metrics-views.md)/[explore](explore-dashboards.md) object level properties (e.g. `models.yaml` or `explore-dashboards.yaml`)
      2. [Environment](/build/models/templating) level properties (e.g. a specific property that have been set for `dev`)
      3. [Project-wide defaults](#project-wide-defaults) for a specific property and resource type

  - title: Setting variables
    description: |
      Primarily useful for [templating](/build/connectors/templating), variables can be set in the `rill.yaml` file directly. This allows variables to be set for your projects deployed to Rill Cloud while still being able to use different variable values locally if you prefer. 
      :::info Overriding variables locally
      Variables also follow an order of precedence and can be overridden locally. By default, any variables defined will be inherited from `rill.yaml`. However, if you manually pass in a variable when starting Rill Developer locally via the CLI, this value will be used instead for the current instance of your running project:
      ```bash
      rill start --env numeric_var=100 --env string_var="different_value"
      ```
      :::
      :::tip Setting variables through `.env`
      Variables can also be set through your project's `<RILL_PROJECT_HOME>/.env` file (or using the `rill env set` CLI command), such as:
      ```bash
      variable=xyz
      ```
      Similar to how [connector credentials can be pushed / pulled](/build/connectors/credentials#pulling-credentials-and-variables-from-a-deployed-project-on-rill-cloud) from local to cloud or vice versa, project variables set locally in Rill Developer can be pushed to Rill Cloud and/or pulled back to your local instance from your deployed project by using the `rill env push` and `rill env pull` commands respectively.

  - title: Managing Paths in Rill
    description: | 
      The public_paths and ignore_paths properties in the rill.yaml file provide control over which files and directories are processed or exposed by Rill. The public_paths property defines a list of file or directory paths to expose over HTTP. By default, it includes ['./public']. The ignore_paths property specifies a list of files or directories that Rill excludes during ingestion and parsing. This prevents unnecessary or incompatible content from affecting the project.
      :::tip
      Don't forget the leading `/` when specifying the path for `ignore_paths` and this path is also assuming the relative path from your project root.

  - title: Testing access policies
    description: |
      During development, it is always a good idea to check if your [access policies](/build/metrics-view/security) are behaving the way you designed them to before pushing these changes into production. You can set mock users which enables a drop down in the dashboard preview to view as a specific user. 
      :::info The View as selector is not visible in my dashboard, why?
      This feature is _only_ enabled when you have set a security policy on the dashboard. By default, the dashboard and it's contents is viewable by every user.
