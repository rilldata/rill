  In your Rill project directory, create a `<theme_name>.yaml` file in any directory containing `type: theme`. Rill will automatically ingest the theme next time you run `rill start` or deploy to Rill Cloud.
  
  To apply that theme to a dashboard, add `default_theme: <name of theme>` to the yaml file for that dashboard. Alternatively, you can add this to the end of the URL in your browser: `?theme=<name of theme>`

  - # Example: You can copy this directly into your <theme_name>.yaml file
