  Both regular models and source models can use the Model YAML specification described on this page. While [SQL models](./models) are perfect for simple transformations, Model YAML files provide advanced capabilities for complex data processing scenarios.

  **When to use Model YAML:**
  - **Partitions** - Optimize performance with data partitioning strategies
  - **Incremental models** - Process only new or changed data efficiently
  - **Pre/post execution hooks** - Run custom logic before or after model execution
  - **Staging** - Create intermediate tables for complex transformations
  - **Output configuration** - Define specific output formats and destinations

  Model YAML files give you fine-grained control over how your data is processed and transformed, making them ideal for production workloads and complex analytics pipelines.
