# SQL Convert Package

This package is a copy of the `sql` package from Go's standard library (v1.24.1).
All test files have been removed as they depend on internal package.

⚠️ **WARNING**: This package should ONLY be used to access the `ConvertAssign` function. Do not use any other functions from this package.
