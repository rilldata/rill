        Here's what you can analyze within the "auctions_metrics" dataset:

        ### Measures (Quantitative Metrics)
        - **Requests**: Total number of bid requests (sum of bid_request_cnt)
        - **Avg Bid Floor**: Average bid floor price (sum of bid_floor divided by sum of has_bid_floor_cnt)
        - **1D Qps**: Requests per second, averaged over a day (sum of bid_request_cnt divided by 86,400)

        ### Dimensions (Ways to Segment the Data)
        You can break down and filter auction metrics by:
        - App/Site: Name, domain, category, or whether it's an app or site
        - Publisher name
        - Ad size, position, and placement type
        - Device: State, OS, OS version, type, country, browser
        - Video duration buckets (min/max)
        - Auction type
        - Bid floor bucket

        This structure allows for deep analysis of auction activity across platforms, devices, geographies, ad formats, and more. Next, I'll check the available time range and sample values, so we know how far back the data goes and what typical values look like.

        Here's what you can analyze within the "auctions_metrics" dataset:

        ### Measures (Quantitative Metrics)
        - **Requests**: Total number of bid requests (sum of bid_request_cnt)
        - **Avg Bid Floor**: Average bid floor price (sum of bid_floor divided by sum of has_bid_floor_cnt)
        - **1D Qps**: Requests per second, averaged over a day (sum of bid_request_cnt divided by 86,400)

        ### Dimensions (Ways to Segment the Data)
        You can break down and filter auction metrics by:
        - App/Site: Name, domain, category, or whether it's an app or site
        - Publisher name
        - Ad size, position, and placement type
        - Device: State, OS, OS version, type, country, browser
        - Video duration buckets (min/max)
        - Auction type
        - Bid floor bucket

        This structure allows for deep analysis of auction activity across platforms, devices, geographies, ad formats, and more. Next, I'll check the available time range and sample values, so we know how far back the data goes and what typical values look like.

        The "bids_metrics" dataset provides a comprehensive view of bidding activity and performance outcomes. Here’s what you can analyze:

        ### Measures (Quantitative Metrics)
        - **Overall Spend**: Total media spend (in USD, per thousand units)
        - **Total Bids**: Number of bids placed
        - **Impressions**: Number of impressions won
        - **Win Rate**: Impressions divided by bids (shows how often bids win)
        - **Clicks**: Number of clicks registered
        - **CTR (Click Through Rate)**: Clicks divided by impressions
        - **Video Starts/Completes**: Counts of video ad starts and completions
        - **Video Completion Rate**: Completions divided by starts
        - **Avg Bid Price**: Average price per bid
        - **eCPM**: Effective cost per thousand impressions
        - **Avg Bid Floor**: Average minimum price required to bid
        - **Bids 7-Day Rolling Avg**: Smoothed trend of bids over time

        ### Dimensions (Ways to Segment the Data)
        You can break down and filter bid metrics by:
        - Advertiser, campaign, line item, ad domain
        - App/site (name, domain, type), publisher
        - Auction type, bid floor bucket, placement type, creative type, interstitial
        - Device (OS, OS version, type, region, browser, SDK, privacy)
        - Player size, video activity

        This enables you to analyze bidding efficiency, spend, and outcomes across advertisers, campaigns, platforms, devices, ad formats, and more. If you want to dig into trends, performance by segment, or optimization opportunities, this dataset is the right place to start.

        Would you like to explore a specific business question or see a high-level overview of recent bidding and auction trends?

        The "bids_metrics" dataset provides a comprehensive view of bidding activity and performance outcomes. Here’s what you can analyze:

        ### Measures (Quantitative Metrics)
        - **Overall Spend**: Total media spend (in USD, per thousand units)
        - **Total Bids**: Number of bids placed
        - **Impressions**: Number of impressions won
        - **Win Rate**: Impressions divided by bids (shows how often bids win)
        - **Clicks**: Number of clicks registered
        - **CTR (Click Through Rate)**: Clicks divided by impressions
        - **Video Starts/Completes**: Counts of video ad starts and completions
        - **Video Completion Rate**: Completions divided by starts
        - **Avg Bid Price**: Average price per bid
        - **eCPM**: Effective cost per thousand impressions
        - **Avg Bid Floor**: Average minimum price required to bid
        - **Bids 7-Day Rolling Avg**: Smoothed trend of bids over time

        ### Dimensions (Ways to Segment the Data)
        You can break down and filter bid metrics by:
        - Advertiser, campaign, line item, ad domain
        - App/site (name, domain, type), publisher
        - Auction type, bid floor bucket, placement type, creative type, interstitial
        - Device (OS, OS version, type, region, browser, SDK, privacy)
        - Player size, video activity

        This enables you to analyze bidding efficiency, spend, and outcomes across advertisers, campaigns, platforms, devices, ad formats, and more. If you want to dig into trends, performance by segment, or optimization opportunities, this dataset is the right place to start.

        Would you like to explore a specific business question or see a high-level overview of recent bidding and auction trends?

        Great question! To answer which non-US country has the most activity, I'll analyze the "auctions_metrics" dataset, since it contains the "device_country" dimension and the "requests" measure (which reflects auction activity).

        Here's my approach:
        1. Query total auction requests by country, excluding the US.
        2. Identify the country with the highest request count.

        Let me pull those numbers for you.

        To give you a thorough overview of the auction metrics, I'll first examine the available measures and dimensions within the "auctions_metrics" dataset. This will help us understand what business questions we can answer and which analytical angles are possible.

        Here's what you can analyze within the "auctions_metrics" dataset:

        ### Measures (Quantitative Metrics)
        - **Requests**: Total number of bid requests (sum of bid_request_cnt)
        - **Avg Bid Floor**: Average bid floor price (sum of bid_floor divided by sum of has_bid_floor_cnt)
        - **1D Qps**: Requests per second, averaged over a day (sum of bid_request_cnt divided by 86,400)

        ### Dimensions (Ways to Segment the Data)
        You can break down and filter auction metrics by:
        - App/Site: Name, domain, category, or whether it's an app or site
        - Publisher name
        - Ad size, position, and placement type
        - Device: State, OS, OS version, type, country, browser
        - Video duration buckets (min/max)
        - Auction type
        - Bid floor bucket

        This structure allows for deep analysis of auction activity across platforms, devices, geographies, ad formats, and more. Next, I'll check the available time range and sample values, so we know how far back the data goes and what typical values look like.

        The non-US country with the most auction activity is the USA, with 572,827,000 requests. However, it appears that "USA" is being treated as distinct from "US" in the data, which may indicate a data quality issue or inconsistent country coding. If you intended to exclude all forms of the United States, including "USA," this result suggests that "USA" is the dominant non-"US" label in your dataset ([see country breakdown](https://app.rilldata.com/dashboards/auctions_metrics?country=USA)).

        Would you like me to refine the query to exclude both "US" and "USA," or investigate further into the next most active country?
