      content: "Here’s what’s in the **`auctions_metrics`** metrics view (structure only — I’m not querying any data values).\n\n## What this metrics view represents\n`auctions_metrics` is built on the underlying model/table **`auctions_data`** and is designed to analyze **auction / bid-request volume and pricing context** (e.g., bid floors) across inventory, device, and placement attributes.\n\n- **Default time dimension:** `__time`\n- **Smallest time grain supported by the view:** `HOUR` (the time dimension itself is timestamp-level, but the view is optimized down to hourly granularity)\n\n## Measures (what you can aggregate)\nThese are the core KPIs you can slice by any of the dimensions below:\n\n- **`requests`**: `sum(bid_request_cnt)`  \n  Total bid requests (auction opportunities).\n\n- **`avg_bid_floor`**: `sum(bid_floor) / sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)`  \n  Average bid floor, computed only over rows where a bid floor exists (using `has_bid_floor_cnt` as the denominator).\n\n- **`1d_qps`**: `sum(bid_request_cnt) / 86400`  \n  Average requests per second, normalized over a day (useful for capacity/throughput style monitoring).\n\n## Dimensions (how you can break metrics down)\n### Time\n- **`__time`** (timestamp)\n\n### Inventory / publisher / app-site\n- `app_site_name`\n- `app_site_domain`\n- `app_site_cat`\n- `pub_name`\n- `app_or_site` (app vs site style split)\n\n### Placement / format\n- `ad_size`\n- `ad_position`\n- `placement_type`\n- `auction_type`\n\n### Video constraints\n- `video_max_duration_bucket`\n- `video_min_duration_bucket`\n\n### Device / platform / geo\n- `device_country`\n- `device_state`\n- `device_os`\n- `device_osv` (OS version)\n- `device_type`\n- `platform_browser`\n\n### Pricing context\n- `bid_floor_bucket` (bucketed bid floor segmentation)\n\n## What this view is best for (practical uses)\n- **Supply monitoring:** requests and QPS trends over time, by publisher/app/site, placement, or geo.\n- **Bid floor strategy:** how `avg_bid_floor` varies by inventory, device, and placement (and by `bid_floor_bucket`).\n- **Mix shifts:** detecting changes in where traffic is coming from (e.g., app vs site, device OS, auction type) that could impact monetization downstream.\n\nIf you tell me what decision you’re trying to make (e.g., “why did revenue drop?” vs “where is traffic growing?”), I can suggest the most relevant cuts of these dimensions—still without querying—so you have a clean analysis plan before we pull numbers."

      content: "Here’s the structure of the **other metrics view: `bids_metrics`** (no data queries—just what’s available to analyze).\n\n## What this metrics view represents\n`bids_metrics` is built on **`bids_data`** and is focused on **demand-side bidding + delivery performance**: bids, wins (impressions), spend, and downstream engagement (clicks, video events). It’s essentially your “campaign performance / marketplace demand” view.\n\n- **Default time dimension:** `__time`\n- **Smallest time grain supported by the view:** `HOUR`\n\n## Measures (KPIs you can aggregate)\n### Spend + volume\n- **`overall_spend`**: `sum(media_spend_usd) / 1000` (USD)  \n  Total spend (note the `/1000` scaling).\n\n- **`total_bids`**: `sum(bid_cnt)`  \n  Total bid count.\n\n- **`impressions`**: `sum(imp_cnt)`  \n  Total wins delivered as impressions.\n\n### Rates / efficiency\n- **`win_rate`**: `sum(imp_cnt) / sum(bid_cnt)`  \n  Win rate (impressions per bid).\n\n- **`avg_bid_price`**: `sum(bid_price_usd) / sum(bid_cnt) / 1000` (USD)  \n  Average bid price (also scaled by `/1000`).\n\n- **`ecpm`**: `sum(media_spend_usd) / 1000 / sum(imp_cnt)` (USD)  \n  Effective CPM.\n\n- **`avg_bid_floor`**: `sum(bid_floor) / sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)` (USD)  \n  Average bid floor where present (same concept as in auctions, but computed in the bids dataset).\n\n### Engagement + video funnel\n- **`clicks`**: `sum(click_reg_cnt)`\n- **`ctr`**: `sum(click_reg_cnt) / sum(imp_cnt)` (guarded by `nullif` to avoid divide-by-zero)\n- **`video_starts`**: `sum(video_start_cnt)`\n- **`video_completes`**: `sum(video_complete_cnt)`\n- **`video_completion_rate`**: `sum(video_complete_cnt) / sum(video_start_cnt)`\n\n### Derived / windowed measure\n- **`bids_7day_rolling_avg`**: rolling average of `total_bids` over the last 7 days (current day + 6 preceding), ordered by `__time`.  \n  This is useful for smoothing volatility and spotting trend breaks without manually building moving averages.\n\n## Dimensions (how you can slice performance)\n### Time\n- `__time`\n\n### Advertiser / campaign hierarchy\n- `advertiser_name`\n- `campaign_name`\n- `line_item_name`\n- `adomain` (advertiser domain)\n\n### Inventory / supply context\n- `pub_name`\n- `app_site_name`\n- `app_site_domain`\n- `app_or_site`\n- `auction_type`\n- `placement_type`\n- `bid_floor_bucket`\n\n### Creative / experience\n- `creative_type`\n- `player_size`\n- `interstitial`\n- `video_activity`\n\n### Device / platform / geo / privacy\n- `device_type`\n- `device_os`\n- `device_osv`\n- `device_region`\n- `platform_browser`\n- `privacy` (boolean)\n- `sdk`\n\n## How it differs from `auctions_metrics` (why you’d use it)\n- **`auctions_metrics`** = supply-side *opportunities* (requests, QPS, bid floor context).\n- **`bids_metrics`** = demand-side *participation + outcomes* (bids, spend, impressions, win rate, CTR, video completion, eCPM).\n\nIf you tell me what you’re trying to diagnose (e.g., “win rate dropped” vs “spend shifted” vs “video completion fell”), I can outline the exact cuts/dimensions I’d use—still without pulling any numbers—before we run the analysis."

Some analyses may require up to 20 queries.\n\n\nIn each iteration, you should:\n- **Observe**: What data patterns emerge? What insights are surfacing? What gaps remain?\n- **Orient**: Based on findings, what analytical angles would be most valuable? How do current insights shape next queries?\n- **Decide**: Choose specific dimensions, filters, time periods, or comparisons to explore\n- **Act**: Execute the query and evaluate results in <thinking> tags\n\n\n\n**Phase 3: visualization**\nCreate a chart: After running \"query_metrics_view\" create a chart using \"create_chart\" unless:\n- The user explicitly requests a table-only response\n- The query returns only a single scalar value\n\nChoose the appropriate chart type based on your data:\n- Time series data: line_chart or area_chart (better for cumulative trends)\n- Category comparisons: bar_chart or stacked_bar\n- Part-to-whole relationships: donut_chart\n- Multiple dimensions: Use color encoding with bar_chart, stacked_bar or line_chart\n- Two measures from the same metrics view: Use combo_chart\n- Multiple measures from the same metrics view (more than 2): Use stacked bar chart with multiple measure fields\n- Distribution across two dimensions: heatmap\n\n</process>\n\n<analysis_guidelines>\n**Phase 1: discovery**: \n- Briefly explain your approach before starting\n- Complete each step fully before proceeding\n- If any step fails, investigate and adapt\n\n**Phase 2: analysis**:\n- Start broad (overall patterns), then drill into specific segments\n- Always include time-based analysis using comparison features (delta_abs, delta_rel)\n- Focus on insights that are surprising, actionable, and quantified\n- Never repeat identical queries - each should explore new analytical angles\n- Use <thinking> tags between queries to evaluate results and plan next steps\n- Aim to make queries with high information density; keep row limits as low as possible and avoid pagination\n- The combined data you load across all queries should be below 10000 rows, ideally much less\n\n**Quality Standards**:\n- Prioritize findings that contradict expectations or reveal hidden patterns\n- Quantify changes and impacts with specific numbers\n- Link insights to business implications and decisions\n\n**Data Accuracy Requirements**:\n- ALL numbers and calculations must come from \"query_metrics_view\" tool results\n- NEVER perform manual calculations or mathematical operations\n- If a desired calculation cannot be achieved through the metrics tools, explicitly state this limitation\n- Use only the exact numbers returned by the tools in your analysis\n</analysis_guidelines>\n\n<guardrails>\nYou only engage in conversation that relates to the project's data.\nIf a question seems unrelated, first inspect the available metrics views to see if it fits the dataset's domain.\nDecline to engage if the topic is clearly outside the scope of the data (e.g., trivia, personal advice), and steer the conversation back to actionable insights grounded in the data.\n</guardrails>\n\n<thinking>\nAfter each query in Phase 2, think through:\n- What patterns or anomalies did this reveal?\n- How does this connect to previous findings?\n- What new questions does this raise?\n- What's the most valuable next query to run?\n- Are there any surprising insights worth highlighting?\n</thinking>\n\n<output_format>\n**Format your analysis using markdown as follows**:\n\nBased on the data analysis, here are the key insights:\n\n1. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]\n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n2. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]\n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n3. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]\n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n [Optional: Offer specific follow-up analysis options] \n\n**Citation Requirements**:\n- Every 'query_metrics_view' result includes an 'open_url' field - use this as a markdown link to cite EVERY quantitative claim made to the user\n- Citations must be inline at the end of a sentence or paragraph, not on a separate line\n- Use descriptive text in sentence case (e.g. \"This suggests Android is valuable ([Device breakdown](url)).\" or \"Revenue increased 25%% ([Revenue by country](url)).\")\n- When one paragraph contains multiple insights from the same query, cite once at the end of the paragraph\n</output_format>\n\n<additional_context>\nThe system allows a max row limit of 250 per query.\n\n\n</additional_context>"

Some analyses may require up to 20 queries.\n\n\nIn each iteration, you should:\n- **Observe**: What data patterns emerge? What insights are surfacing? What gaps remain?\n- **Orient**: Based on findings, what analytical angles would be most valuable? How do current insights shape next queries?\n- **Decide**: Choose specific dimensions, filters, time periods, or comparisons to explore\n- **Act**: Execute the query and evaluate results in <thinking> tags\n\n\n\n**Phase 3: visualization**\nCreate a chart: After running \"query_metrics_view\" create a chart using \"create_chart\" unless:\n- The user explicitly requests a table-only response\n- The query returns only a single scalar value\n\nChoose the appropriate chart type based on your data:\n- Time series data: line_chart or area_chart (better for cumulative trends)\n- Category comparisons: bar_chart or stacked_bar\n- Part-to-whole relationships: donut_chart\n- Multiple dimensions: Use color encoding with bar_chart, stacked_bar or line_chart\n- Two measures from the same metrics view: Use combo_chart\n- Multiple measures from the same metrics view (more than 2): Use stacked bar chart with multiple measure fields\n- Distribution across two dimensions: heatmap\n\n</process>\n\n<analysis_guidelines>\n**Phase 1: discovery**: \n- Briefly explain your approach before starting\n- Complete each step fully before proceeding\n- If any step fails, investigate and adapt\n\n**Phase 2: analysis**:\n- Start broad (overall patterns), then drill into specific segments\n- Always include time-based analysis using comparison features (delta_abs, delta_rel)\n- Focus on insights that are surprising, actionable, and quantified\n- Never repeat identical queries - each should explore new analytical angles\n- Use <thinking> tags between queries to evaluate results and plan next steps\n- Aim to make queries with high information density; keep row limits as low as possible and avoid pagination\n- The combined data you load across all queries should be below 10000 rows, ideally much less\n\n**Quality Standards**:\n- Prioritize findings that contradict expectations or reveal hidden patterns\n- Quantify changes and impacts with specific numbers\n- Link insights to business implications and decisions\n\n**Data Accuracy Requirements**:\n- ALL numbers and calculations must come from \"query_metrics_view\" tool results\n- NEVER perform manual calculations or mathematical operations\n- If a desired calculation cannot be achieved through the metrics tools, explicitly state this limitation\n- Use only the exact numbers returned by the tools in your analysis\n</analysis_guidelines>\n\n<guardrails>\nYou only engage in conversation that relates to the project's data.\nIf a question seems unrelated, first inspect the available metrics views to see if it fits the dataset's domain.\nDecline to engage if the topic is clearly outside the scope of the data (e.g., trivia, personal advice), and steer the conversation back to actionable insights grounded in the data.\n</guardrails>\n\n<thinking>\nAfter each query in Phase 2, think through:\n- What patterns or anomalies did this reveal?\n- How does this connect to previous findings?\n- What new questions does this raise?\n- What's the most valuable next query to run?\n- Are there any surprising insights worth highlighting?\n</thinking>\n\n<output_format>\n**Format your analysis using markdown as follows**:\n\nBased on the data analysis, here are the key insights:\n\n1. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]\n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n2. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]\n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n3. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]\n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n [Optional: Offer specific follow-up analysis options] \n\n**Citation Requirements**:\n- Every 'query_metrics_view' result includes an 'open_url' field - use this as a markdown link to cite EVERY quantitative claim made to the user\n- Citations must be inline at the end of a sentence or paragraph, not on a separate line\n- Use descriptive text in sentence case (e.g. \"This suggests Android is valuable ([Device breakdown](url)).\" or \"Revenue increased 25%% ([Revenue by country](url)).\")\n- When one paragraph contains multiple insights from the same query, cite once at the end of the paragraph\n</output_format>\n\n<additional_context>\nThe system allows a max row limit of 250 per query.\n\n\n</additional_context>"

It’s essentially your “campaign performance / marketplace demand” view.\n\n- **Default time dimension:** `__time`\n- **Smallest time grain supported by the view:** `HOUR`\n\n## Measures (KPIs you can aggregate)\n### Spend + volume\n- **`overall_spend`**: `sum(media_spend_usd) / 1000` (USD)  \n  Total spend (note the `/1000` scaling).\n\n- **`total_bids`**: `sum(bid_cnt)`  \n  Total bid count.\n\n- **`impressions`**: `sum(imp_cnt)`  \n  Total wins delivered as impressions.\n\n### Rates / efficiency\n- **`win_rate`**: `sum(imp_cnt) / sum(bid_cnt)`  \n  Win rate (impressions per bid).\n\n- **`avg_bid_price`**: `sum(bid_price_usd) / sum(bid_cnt) / 1000` (USD)  \n  Average bid price (also scaled by `/1000`).\n\n- **`ecpm`**: `sum(media_spend_usd) / 1000 / sum(imp_cnt)` (USD)  \n  Effective CPM.\n\n- **`avg_bid_floor`**: `sum(bid_floor) / sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)` (USD)  \n  Average bid floor where present (same concept as in auctions, but computed in the bids dataset).\n\n### Engagement + video funnel\n- **`clicks`**: `sum(click_reg_cnt)`\n- **`ctr`**: `sum(click_reg_cnt) / sum(imp_cnt)` (guarded by `nullif` to avoid divide-by-zero)\n- **`video_starts`**: `sum(video_start_cnt)`\n- **`video_completes`**: `sum(video_complete_cnt)`\n- **`video_completion_rate`**: `sum(video_complete_cnt) / sum(video_start_cnt)`\n\n### Derived / windowed measure\n- **`bids_7day_rolling_avg`**: rolling average of `total_bids` over the last 7 days (current day + 6 preceding), ordered by `__time`.  \n  This is useful for smoothing volatility and spotting trend breaks without manually building moving averages.\n\n## Dimensions (how you can slice performance)\n### Time\n- `__time`\n\n### Advertiser / campaign hierarchy\n- `advertiser_name`\n- `campaign_name`\n- `line_item_name`\n- `adomain` (advertiser domain)\n\n### Inventory / supply context\n- `pub_name`\n- `app_site_name`\n- `app_site_domain`\n- `app_or_site`\n- `auction_type`\n- `placement_type`\n- `bid_floor_bucket`\n\n### Creative / experience\n- `creative_type`\n- `player_size`\n- `interstitial`\n- `video_activity`\n\n### Device / platform / geo / privacy\n- `device_type`\n- `device_os`\n- `device_osv`\n- `device_region`\n- `platform_browser`\n- `privacy` (boolean)\n- `sdk`\n\n## How it differs from `auctions_metrics` (why you’d use it)\n- **`auctions_metrics`** = supply-side *opportunities* (requests, QPS, bid floor context).\n- **`bids_metrics`** = demand-side *participation + outcomes* (bids, spend, impressions, win rate, CTR, video completion, eCPM).\n\nIf you tell me what you’re trying to diagnose (e.g., “win rate dropped” vs “spend shifted” vs “video completion fell”), I can outline the exact cuts/dimensions I’d use—still without pulling any numbers—before we run the analysis."

Some analyses may require up to 20 queries.\n\n\nIn each iteration, you should:\n- **Observe**: What data patterns emerge? What insights are surfacing? What gaps remain?\n- **Orient**: Based on findings, what analytical angles would be most valuable? How do current insights shape next queries?\n- **Decide**: Choose specific dimensions, filters, time periods, or comparisons to explore\n- **Act**: Execute the query and evaluate results in <thinking> tags\n\n\n\n**Phase 3: visualization**\nCreate a chart: After running \"query_metrics_view\" create a chart using \"create_chart\" unless:\n- The user explicitly requests a table-only response\n- The query returns only a single scalar value\n\nChoose the appropriate chart type based on your data:\n- Time series data: line_chart or area_chart (better for cumulative trends)\n- Category comparisons: bar_chart or stacked_bar\n- Part-to-whole relationships: donut_chart\n- Multiple dimensions: Use color encoding with bar_chart, stacked_bar or line_chart\n- Two measures from the same metrics view: Use combo_chart\n- Multiple measures from the same metrics view (more than 2): Use stacked bar chart with multiple measure fields\n- Distribution across two dimensions: heatmap\n\n</process>\n\n<analysis_guidelines>\n**Phase 1: discovery**: \n- Briefly explain your approach before starting\n- Complete each step fully before proceeding\n- If any step fails, investigate and adapt\n\n**Phase 2: analysis**:\n- Start broad (overall patterns), then drill into specific segments\n- Always include time-based analysis using comparison features (delta_abs, delta_rel)\n- Focus on insights that are surprising, actionable, and quantified\n- Never repeat identical queries - each should explore new analytical angles\n- Use <thinking> tags between queries to evaluate results and plan next steps\n- Aim to make queries with high information density; keep row limits as low as possible and avoid pagination\n- The combined data you load across all queries should be below 10000 rows, ideally much less\n\n**Quality Standards**:\n- Prioritize findings that contradict expectations or reveal hidden patterns\n- Quantify changes and impacts with specific numbers\n- Link insights to business implications and decisions\n\n**Data Accuracy Requirements**:\n- ALL numbers and calculations must come from \"query_metrics_view\" tool results\n- NEVER perform manual calculations or mathematical operations\n- If a desired calculation cannot be achieved through the metrics tools, explicitly state this limitation\n- Use only the exact numbers returned by the tools in your analysis\n</analysis_guidelines>\n\n<guardrails>\nYou only engage in conversation that relates to the project's data.\nIf a question seems unrelated, first inspect the available metrics views to see if it fits the dataset's domain.\nDecline to engage if the topic is clearly outside the scope of the data (e.g., trivia, personal advice), and steer the conversation back to actionable insights grounded in the data.\n</guardrails>\n\n<thinking>\nAfter each query in Phase 2, think through:\n- What patterns or anomalies did this reveal?\n- How does this connect to previous findings?\n- What new questions does this raise?\n- What's the most valuable next query to run?\n- Are there any surprising insights worth highlighting?\n</thinking>\n\n<output_format>\n**Format your analysis using markdown as follows**:\n\nBased on the data analysis, here are the key insights:\n\n1. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]\n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n2. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]\n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n3. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]\n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n [Optional: Offer specific follow-up analysis options] \n\n**Citation Requirements**:\n- Every 'query_metrics_view' result includes an 'open_url' field - use this as a markdown link to cite EVERY quantitative claim made to the user\n- Citations must be inline at the end of a sentence or paragraph, not on a separate line\n- Use descriptive text in sentence case (e.g. \"This suggests Android is valuable ([Device breakdown](url)).\" or \"Revenue increased 25%% ([Revenue by country](url)).\")\n- When one paragraph contains multiple insights from the same query, cite once at the end of the paragraph\n</output_format>\n\n<additional_context>\nThe system allows a max row limit of 250 per query.\n\n\n</additional_context>"

      content: "Here’s the structure of the **other metrics view: `bids_metrics`** (no data queries—just what’s available to analyze).\n\n## What this metrics view represents\n`bids_metrics` is built on **`bids_data`** and is focused on **demand-side bidding + delivery performance**: bids, wins (impressions), spend, and downstream engagement (clicks, video events). It’s essentially your “campaign performance / marketplace demand” view.\n\n- **Default time dimension:** `__time`\n- **Smallest time grain supported by the view:** `HOUR`\n\n## Measures (KPIs you can aggregate)\n### Spend + volume\n- **`overall_spend`**: `sum(media_spend_usd) / 1000` (USD)  \n  Total spend (note the `/1000` scaling).\n\n- **`total_bids`**: `sum(bid_cnt)`  \n  Total bid count.\n\n- **`impressions`**: `sum(imp_cnt)`  \n  Total wins delivered as impressions.\n\n### Rates / efficiency\n- **`win_rate`**: `sum(imp_cnt) / sum(bid_cnt)`  \n  Win rate (impressions per bid).\n\n- **`avg_bid_price`**: `sum(bid_price_usd) / sum(bid_cnt) / 1000` (USD)  \n  Average bid price (also scaled by `/1000`).\n\n- **`ecpm`**: `sum(media_spend_usd) / 1000 / sum(imp_cnt)` (USD)  \n  Effective CPM.\n\n- **`avg_bid_floor`**: `sum(bid_floor) / sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)` (USD)  \n  Average bid floor where present (same concept as in auctions, but computed in the bids dataset).\n\n### Engagement + video funnel\n- **`clicks`**: `sum(click_reg_cnt)`\n- **`ctr`**: `sum(click_reg_cnt) / sum(imp_cnt)` (guarded by `nullif` to avoid divide-by-zero)\n- **`video_starts`**: `sum(video_start_cnt)`\n- **`video_completes`**: `sum(video_complete_cnt)`\n- **`video_completion_rate`**: `sum(video_complete_cnt) / sum(video_start_cnt)`\n\n### Derived / windowed measure\n- **`bids_7day_rolling_avg`**: rolling average of `total_bids` over the last 7 days (current day + 6 preceding), ordered by `__time`.  \n  This is useful for smoothing volatility and spotting trend breaks without manually building moving averages.\n\n## Dimensions (how you can slice performance)\n### Time\n- `__time`\n\n### Advertiser / campaign hierarchy\n- `advertiser_name`\n- `campaign_name`\n- `line_item_name`\n- `adomain` (advertiser domain)\n\n### Inventory / supply context\n- `pub_name`\n- `app_site_name`\n- `app_site_domain`\n- `app_or_site`\n- `auction_type`\n- `placement_type`\n- `bid_floor_bucket`\n\n### Creative / experience\n- `creative_type`\n- `player_size`\n- `interstitial`\n- `video_activity`\n\n### Device / platform / geo / privacy\n- `device_type`\n- `device_os`\n- `device_osv`\n- `device_region`\n- `platform_browser`\n- `privacy` (boolean)\n- `sdk`\n\n## How it differs from `auctions_metrics` (why you’d use it)\n- **`auctions_metrics`** = supply-side *opportunities* (requests, QPS, bid floor context).\n- **`bids_metrics`** = demand-side *participation + outcomes* (bids, spend, impressions, win rate, CTR, video completion, eCPM).\n\nIf you tell me what you’re trying to diagnose (e.g., “win rate dropped” vs “spend shifted” vs “video completion fell”), I can outline the exact cuts/dimensions I’d use—still without pulling any numbers—before we run the analysis."
