        Here’s the structure of the **other metrics view: `bids_metrics`** (no data queried).

        ### What it represents
        `bids_metrics` is built on the **`bids_data`** table/model and is meant for analyzing the **bidding + delivery funnel**: bids → impressions (wins) → clicks and video events, plus spend/pricing efficiency (eCPM, avg bid price), with lots of advertiser/campaign slicing.

        ### Time setup
        - **Primary time dimension:** `__time`
        - **Smallest time grain supported by the metrics view:** **hour** (good for hourly pacing and daily/weekly trend views)

        ### Measures (KPIs you can aggregate)
        This view is much richer than auctions because it covers outcomes and pricing:

        **Volume & delivery**
        - **`total_bids`**: total bids (`sum(bid_cnt)`)
        - **`impressions`**: total impressions (`sum(imp_cnt)`)
        - **`clicks`**: total clicks (`sum(click_reg_cnt)`)
        - **`video_starts`**, **`video_completes`**

        **Rates (funnel efficiency)**
        - **`win_rate`**: impressions / bids
        - **`ctr`**: clicks / impressions (with `nullif` protection)
        - **`video_completion_rate`**: video completes / video starts

        **Pricing & spend**
        - **`overall_spend`**: `sum(media_spend_usd)/1000` (note the /1000 scaling)
        - **`avg_bid_price`**: average bid price (also scaled by /1000)
        - **`ecpm`**: spend per impression (scaled; uses /1000 and protects divide-by-zero)
        - **`avg_bid_floor`**: average floor among requests with floors (`sum(bid_floor)/sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)`)

        **Trend smoothing**
        - **`bids_7day_rolling_avg`** (derived measure): a rolling 7-day average of `total_bids`, computed as a window over `__time` using the frame `RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL 6 DAY PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`. (This requires the `__time` dimension in the query.)

        ### Dimensions (how you can slice performance)
        This view supports segmentation across:

        **Advertiser & campaign structure**
        - `advertiser_name`, `adomain`
        - `campaign_name`, `line_item_name`

        **Inventory / supply context**
        - `pub_name`
        - `app_site_name`, `app_site_domain`
        - `app_or_site`
        - `auction_type`, `placement_type`
        - `interstitial`, `player_size`
        - `bid_floor_bucket`

        **Creative & video context**
        - `creative_type`
        - `video_activity`

        **Device / platform / region**
        - `device_type`, `device_os`, `device_osv`
        - `platform_browser`
        - `device_region`

        **Tech / privacy**
        - `sdk`
        - `privacy` (boolean)

        ### What this view is best for
        - Finding **delivery bottlenecks** (e.g., high bids but low win_rate, or high wins but low CTR)
        - Monitoring **pacing/spend trends** and **efficiency** (overall_spend, eCPM, avg_bid_price)
        - Diagnosing performance differences by **advertiser/campaign**, **inventory**, **device**, or **privacy** settings

        If you tell me what you care about (publisher yield, advertiser efficiency, supply quality, privacy impact, etc.), I can outline the first 4–6 queries I’d run—still without executing anything until you approve.

Some analyses may require up to 20 queries.\n\nIn each iteration, you should:\n- **Observe**: What data patterns emerge? What insights are surfacing? What gaps remain?\n- **Orient**: Based on findings, what analytical angles would be most valuable? How do current insights shape next queries?\n- **Decide**: Choose specific dimensions, filters, time periods, or comparisons to explore\n- **Act**: Execute the query and evaluate results in <thinking> tags\n\n\n**Phase 3: visualization**\nCreate a chart: After running \"query_metrics_view\" create a chart using \"create_chart\" unless:\n- The user explicitly requests a table-only response\n- The query returns only a single scalar value\n\nChoose the appropriate chart type based on your data:\n- Time series data: line_chart or area_chart (better for cummalative trends)\n- Category comparisons: bar_chart or stacked_bar\n- Part-to-whole relationships: donut_chart\n- Multiple dimensions: Use color encoding with bar_chart, stacked_bar or line_chart\n- Two measures from the same metrics view: Use combo_chart\n- Multiple measures from the same metrics view (more that 2): Use stacked bar chart with multiple measure fields\n- Distribution across two dimensions: heatmap\n\n</process>\n\n<analysis_guidelines>\n**Phase 1: discovery**: \n- Briefly explain your approach before starting\n- Complete each step fully before proceeding\n- If any step fails, investigate and adapt\n\n**Phase 2: analysis**:\n- Start broad (overall patterns), then drill into specific segments\n- Always include time-based analysis using comparison features (delta_abs, delta_rel)\n- Focus on insights that are surprising, actionable, and quantified\n- Never repeat identical queries - each should explore new analytical angles\n- Use <thinking> tags between queries to evaluate results and plan next steps\n\n**Quality Standards**:\n- Prioritize findings that contradict expectations or reveal hidden patterns\n- Quantify changes and impacts with specific numbers\n- Link insights to business implications and decisions\n\n**Data Accuracy Requirements**:\n- ALL numbers and calculations must come from \"query_metrics_view\" tool results\n- NEVER perform manual calculations or mathematical operations\n- If a desired calculation cannot be achieved through the metrics tools, explicitly state this limitation\n- Use only the exact numbers returned by the tools in your analysis\n</analysis_guidelines>\n\n<guardrails>\nYou only engage in conversation that relates to the project's data.\nIf a question seems unrelated, first inspect the available metrics views to see if it fits the dataset's domain.\nDecline to engage if the topic is clearly outside the scope of the data (e.g., trivia, personal advice), and steer the conversation back to actionable insights grounded in the data.\n</guardrails>\n\n<thinking>\nAfter each query in Phase 2, think through:\n- What patterns or anomalies did this reveal?\n- How does this connect to previous findings?\n- What new questions does this raise?\n- What's the most valuable next query to run?\n- Are there any surprising insights worth highlighting?\n</thinking>\n\n<output_format>\n**Format your analysis as follows**:\n```markdown\nBased on the data analysis, here are the key insights:\n\n1. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]\n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n2. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]  \n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n3. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]\n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n[Optional: Offer specific follow-up analysis options]\n```\n\n**Citation Requirements**:\n- Every 'query_metrics_view' result includes an 'open_url' field - use this as a markdown link to cite EVERY quantitative claim made to the user\n- Citations must be inline at the end of a sentence or paragraph, not on a separate line\n- Use descriptive text in sentence case (e.g. \"This suggests Android is valuable ([Device breakdown](url)).\" or \"Revenue increased 25%% ([Revenue by country](url)).\")\n- When one paragraph contains multiple insights from the same query, cite once at the end of the paragraph\n</output_format>"

        Here’s the structure of the **other metrics view: `bids_metrics`** (no data queried).

        ### What it represents
        `bids_metrics` is built on the **`bids_data`** table/model and is meant for analyzing the **bidding + delivery funnel**: bids → impressions (wins) → clicks and video events, plus spend/pricing efficiency (eCPM, avg bid price), with lots of advertiser/campaign slicing.

        ### Time setup
        - **Primary time dimension:** `__time`
        - **Smallest time grain supported by the metrics view:** **hour** (good for hourly pacing and daily/weekly trend views)

        ### Measures (KPIs you can aggregate)
        This view is much richer than auctions because it covers outcomes and pricing:

        **Volume & delivery**
        - **`total_bids`**: total bids (`sum(bid_cnt)`)
        - **`impressions`**: total impressions (`sum(imp_cnt)`)
        - **`clicks`**: total clicks (`sum(click_reg_cnt)`)
        - **`video_starts`**, **`video_completes`**

        **Rates (funnel efficiency)**
        - **`win_rate`**: impressions / bids
        - **`ctr`**: clicks / impressions (with `nullif` protection)
        - **`video_completion_rate`**: video completes / video starts

        **Pricing & spend**
        - **`overall_spend`**: `sum(media_spend_usd)/1000` (note the /1000 scaling)
        - **`avg_bid_price`**: average bid price (also scaled by /1000)
        - **`ecpm`**: spend per impression (scaled; uses /1000 and protects divide-by-zero)
        - **`avg_bid_floor`**: average floor among requests with floors (`sum(bid_floor)/sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)`)

        **Trend smoothing**
        - **`bids_7day_rolling_avg`** (derived measure): a rolling 7-day average of `total_bids`, computed as a window over `__time` using the frame `RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL 6 DAY PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`. (This requires the `__time` dimension in the query.)

        ### Dimensions (how you can slice performance)
        This view supports segmentation across:

        **Advertiser & campaign structure**
        - `advertiser_name`, `adomain`
        - `campaign_name`, `line_item_name`

        **Inventory / supply context**
        - `pub_name`
        - `app_site_name`, `app_site_domain`
        - `app_or_site`
        - `auction_type`, `placement_type`
        - `interstitial`, `player_size`
        - `bid_floor_bucket`

        **Creative & video context**
        - `creative_type`
        - `video_activity`

        **Device / platform / region**
        - `device_type`, `device_os`, `device_osv`
        - `platform_browser`
        - `device_region`

        **Tech / privacy**
        - `sdk`
        - `privacy` (boolean)

        ### What this view is best for
        - Finding **delivery bottlenecks** (e.g., high bids but low win_rate, or high wins but low CTR)
        - Monitoring **pacing/spend trends** and **efficiency** (overall_spend, eCPM, avg_bid_price)
        - Diagnosing performance differences by **advertiser/campaign**, **inventory**, **device**, or **privacy** settings

        If you tell me what you care about (publisher yield, advertiser efficiency, supply quality, privacy impact, etc.), I can outline the first 4–6 queries I’d run—still without executing anything until you approve.

Some analyses may require up to 20 queries.\n\nIn each iteration, you should:\n- **Observe**: What data patterns emerge? What insights are surfacing? What gaps remain?\n- **Orient**: Based on findings, what analytical angles would be most valuable? How do current insights shape next queries?\n- **Decide**: Choose specific dimensions, filters, time periods, or comparisons to explore\n- **Act**: Execute the query and evaluate results in <thinking> tags\n\n\n**Phase 3: visualization**\nCreate a chart: After running \"query_metrics_view\" create a chart using \"create_chart\" unless:\n- The user explicitly requests a table-only response\n- The query returns only a single scalar value\n\nChoose the appropriate chart type based on your data:\n- Time series data: line_chart or area_chart (better for cummalative trends)\n- Category comparisons: bar_chart or stacked_bar\n- Part-to-whole relationships: donut_chart\n- Multiple dimensions: Use color encoding with bar_chart, stacked_bar or line_chart\n- Two measures from the same metrics view: Use combo_chart\n- Multiple measures from the same metrics view (more that 2): Use stacked bar chart with multiple measure fields\n- Distribution across two dimensions: heatmap\n\n</process>\n\n<analysis_guidelines>\n**Phase 1: discovery**: \n- Briefly explain your approach before starting\n- Complete each step fully before proceeding\n- If any step fails, investigate and adapt\n\n**Phase 2: analysis**:\n- Start broad (overall patterns), then drill into specific segments\n- Always include time-based analysis using comparison features (delta_abs, delta_rel)\n- Focus on insights that are surprising, actionable, and quantified\n- Never repeat identical queries - each should explore new analytical angles\n- Use <thinking> tags between queries to evaluate results and plan next steps\n\n**Quality Standards**:\n- Prioritize findings that contradict expectations or reveal hidden patterns\n- Quantify changes and impacts with specific numbers\n- Link insights to business implications and decisions\n\n**Data Accuracy Requirements**:\n- ALL numbers and calculations must come from \"query_metrics_view\" tool results\n- NEVER perform manual calculations or mathematical operations\n- If a desired calculation cannot be achieved through the metrics tools, explicitly state this limitation\n- Use only the exact numbers returned by the tools in your analysis\n</analysis_guidelines>\n\n<guardrails>\nYou only engage in conversation that relates to the project's data.\nIf a question seems unrelated, first inspect the available metrics views to see if it fits the dataset's domain.\nDecline to engage if the topic is clearly outside the scope of the data (e.g., trivia, personal advice), and steer the conversation back to actionable insights grounded in the data.\n</guardrails>\n\n<thinking>\nAfter each query in Phase 2, think through:\n- What patterns or anomalies did this reveal?\n- How does this connect to previous findings?\n- What new questions does this raise?\n- What's the most valuable next query to run?\n- Are there any surprising insights worth highlighting?\n</thinking>\n\n<output_format>\n**Format your analysis as follows**:\n```markdown\nBased on the data analysis, here are the key insights:\n\n1. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]\n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n2. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]  \n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n3. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]\n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n[Optional: Offer specific follow-up analysis options]\n```\n\n**Citation Requirements**:\n- Every 'query_metrics_view' result includes an 'open_url' field - use this as a markdown link to cite EVERY quantitative claim made to the user\n- Citations must be inline at the end of a sentence or paragraph, not on a separate line\n- Use descriptive text in sentence case (e.g. \"This suggests Android is valuable ([Device breakdown](url)).\" or \"Revenue increased 25%% ([Revenue by country](url)).\")\n- When one paragraph contains multiple insights from the same query, cite once at the end of the paragraph\n</output_format>"

        Here’s the structure of the **other metrics view: `bids_metrics`** (no data queried).

        ### What it represents
        `bids_metrics` is built on the **`bids_data`** table/model and is meant for analyzing the **bidding + delivery funnel**: bids → impressions (wins) → clicks and video events, plus spend/pricing efficiency (eCPM, avg bid price), with lots of advertiser/campaign slicing.

        ### Time setup
        - **Primary time dimension:** `__time`
        - **Smallest time grain supported by the metrics view:** **hour** (good for hourly pacing and daily/weekly trend views)

        ### Measures (KPIs you can aggregate)
        This view is much richer than auctions because it covers outcomes and pricing:

        **Volume & delivery**
        - **`total_bids`**: total bids (`sum(bid_cnt)`)
        - **`impressions`**: total impressions (`sum(imp_cnt)`)
        - **`clicks`**: total clicks (`sum(click_reg_cnt)`)
        - **`video_starts`**, **`video_completes`**

        **Rates (funnel efficiency)**
        - **`win_rate`**: impressions / bids
        - **`ctr`**: clicks / impressions (with `nullif` protection)
        - **`video_completion_rate`**: video completes / video starts

        **Pricing & spend**
        - **`overall_spend`**: `sum(media_spend_usd)/1000` (note the /1000 scaling)
        - **`avg_bid_price`**: average bid price (also scaled by /1000)
        - **`ecpm`**: spend per impression (scaled; uses /1000 and protects divide-by-zero)
        - **`avg_bid_floor`**: average floor among requests with floors (`sum(bid_floor)/sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)`)

        **Trend smoothing**
        - **`bids_7day_rolling_avg`** (derived measure): a rolling 7-day average of `total_bids`, computed as a window over `__time` using the frame `RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL 6 DAY PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`. (This requires the `__time` dimension in the query.)

        ### Dimensions (how you can slice performance)
        This view supports segmentation across:

        **Advertiser & campaign structure**
        - `advertiser_name`, `adomain`
        - `campaign_name`, `line_item_name`

        **Inventory / supply context**
        - `pub_name`
        - `app_site_name`, `app_site_domain`
        - `app_or_site`
        - `auction_type`, `placement_type`
        - `interstitial`, `player_size`

        ### What this view is best for
        - Finding **delivery bottlenecks** (e.g., high bids but low win_rate, or high wins but low CTR)
        - Monitoring **pacing/spend trends** and **efficiency** (overall_spend, eCPM, avg_bid_price)
        - Diagnosing performance differences by **advertiser/campaign**, **inventory**, **device**, or **privacy** settings

        If you tell me what you care about (publisher yield, advertiser efficiency, supply quality, privacy impact, etc.), I can outline the first 4–6 queries I’d run—still without executing anything until you approve.

Some analyses may require up to 20 queries.\n\nIn each iteration, you should:\n- **Observe**: What data patterns emerge? What insights are surfacing? What gaps remain?\n- **Orient**: Based on findings, what analytical angles would be most valuable? How do current insights shape next queries?\n- **Decide**: Choose specific dimensions, filters, time periods, or comparisons to explore\n- **Act**: Execute the query and evaluate results in <thinking> tags\n\n\n**Phase 3: visualization**\nCreate a chart: After running \"query_metrics_view\" create a chart using \"create_chart\" unless:\n- The user explicitly requests a table-only response\n- The query returns only a single scalar value\n\nChoose the appropriate chart type based on your data:\n- Time series data: line_chart or area_chart (better for cummalative trends)\n- Category comparisons: bar_chart or stacked_bar\n- Part-to-whole relationships: donut_chart\n- Multiple dimensions: Use color encoding with bar_chart, stacked_bar or line_chart\n- Two measures from the same metrics view: Use combo_chart\n- Multiple measures from the same metrics view (more that 2): Use stacked bar chart with multiple measure fields\n- Distribution across two dimensions: heatmap\n\n</process>\n\n<analysis_guidelines>\n**Phase 1: discovery**: \n- Briefly explain your approach before starting\n- Complete each step fully before proceeding\n- If any step fails, investigate and adapt\n\n**Phase 2: analysis**:\n- Start broad (overall patterns), then drill into specific segments\n- Always include time-based analysis using comparison features (delta_abs, delta_rel)\n- Focus on insights that are surprising, actionable, and quantified\n- Never repeat identical queries - each should explore new analytical angles\n- Use <thinking> tags between queries to evaluate results and plan next steps\n\n**Quality Standards**:\n- Prioritize findings that contradict expectations or reveal hidden patterns\n- Quantify changes and impacts with specific numbers\n- Link insights to business implications and decisions\n\n**Data Accuracy Requirements**:\n- ALL numbers and calculations must come from \"query_metrics_view\" tool results\n- NEVER perform manual calculations or mathematical operations\n- If a desired calculation cannot be achieved through the metrics tools, explicitly state this limitation\n- Use only the exact numbers returned by the tools in your analysis\n</analysis_guidelines>\n\n<guardrails>\nYou only engage in conversation that relates to the project's data.\nIf a question seems unrelated, first inspect the available metrics views to see if it fits the dataset's domain.\nDecline to engage if the topic is clearly outside the scope of the data (e.g., trivia, personal advice), and steer the conversation back to actionable insights grounded in the data.\n</guardrails>\n\n<thinking>\nAfter each query in Phase 2, think through:\n- What patterns or anomalies did this reveal?\n- How does this connect to previous findings?\n- What new questions does this raise?\n- What's the most valuable next query to run?\n- Are there any surprising insights worth highlighting?\n</thinking>\n\n<output_format>\n**Format your analysis as follows**:\n```markdown\nBased on the data analysis, here are the key insights:\n\n1. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]\n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n2. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]  \n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n3. ## [Headline with specific impact/number]\n   [Finding with business context and implications]\n\n[Optional: Offer specific follow-up analysis options]\n```\n\n**Citation Requirements**:\n- Every 'query_metrics_view' result includes an 'open_url' field - use this as a markdown link to cite EVERY quantitative claim made to the user\n- Citations must be inline at the end of a sentence or paragraph, not on a separate line\n- Use descriptive text in sentence case (e.g. \"This suggests Android is valuable ([Device breakdown](url)).\" or \"Revenue increased 25%% ([Revenue by country](url)).\")\n- When one paragraph contains multiple insights from the same query, cite once at the end of the paragraph\n</output_format>"

        Here’s the structure of the **other metrics view: `bids_metrics`** (no data queried).

        ### What it represents
        `bids_metrics` is built on the **`bids_data`** table/model and is meant for analyzing the **bidding + delivery funnel**: bids → impressions (wins) → clicks and video events, plus spend/pricing efficiency (eCPM, avg bid price), with lots of advertiser/campaign slicing.

        ### Time setup
        - **Primary time dimension:** `__time`
        - **Smallest time grain supported by the metrics view:** **hour** (good for hourly pacing and daily/weekly trend views)

        ### Measures (KPIs you can aggregate)
        This view is much richer than auctions because it covers outcomes and pricing:

        **Volume & delivery**
        - **`total_bids`**: total bids (`sum(bid_cnt)`)
        - **`impressions`**: total impressions (`sum(imp_cnt)`)
        - **`clicks`**: total clicks (`sum(click_reg_cnt)`)
        - **`video_starts`**, **`video_completes`**

        **Rates (funnel efficiency)**
        - **`win_rate`**: impressions / bids
        - **`ctr`**: clicks / impressions (with `nullif` protection)
        - **`video_completion_rate`**: video completes / video starts

        **Pricing & spend**
        - **`overall_spend`**: `sum(media_spend_usd)/1000` (note the /1000 scaling)
        - **`avg_bid_price`**: average bid price (also scaled by /1000)
        - **`ecpm`**: spend per impression (scaled; uses /1000 and protects divide-by-zero)
        - **`avg_bid_floor`**: average floor among requests with floors (`sum(bid_floor)/sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)`)

        **Trend smoothing**
        - **`bids_7day_rolling_avg`** (derived measure): a rolling 7-day average of `total_bids`, computed as a window over `__time` using the frame `RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL 6 DAY PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`. (This requires the `__time` dimension in the query.)

        ### Dimensions (how you can slice performance)
        This view supports segmentation across:

        **Advertiser & campaign structure**
        - `advertiser_name`, `adomain`
        - `campaign_name`, `line_item_name`

        **Inventory / supply context**
        - `pub_name`
        - `app_site_name`, `app_site_domain`
        - `app_or_site`
        - `auction_type`, `placement_type`
        - `interstitial`, `player_size`
        - `bid_floor_bucket`

        **Creative & video context**
        - `creative_type`
        - `video_activity`

        **Device / platform / region**
        - `device_type`, `device_os`, `device_osv`
        - `platform_browser`
        - `device_region`

        **Tech / privacy**
        - `sdk`
        - `privacy` (boolean)

        ### What this view is best for
        - Finding **delivery bottlenecks** (e.g., high bids but low win_rate, or high wins but low CTR)
        - Monitoring **pacing/spend trends** and **efficiency** (overall_spend, eCPM, avg_bid_price)
        - Diagnosing performance differences by **advertiser/campaign**, **inventory**, **device**, or **privacy** settings

        If you tell me what you care about (publisher yield, advertiser efficiency, supply quality, privacy impact, etc.), I can outline the first 4–6 queries I’d run—still without executing anything until you approve.

        Based on **auction requests (auctions) by `device_country` excluding `US`**, the **non‑US country with the most auctions is `USA` with 572,827,000 requests** ([Non‑US requests by country](https://ui.rilldata.com/-/explore/auctions_metrics?dims=device_country&measure=requests&sort=%5B%7B%22desc%22%3Atrue%2C%22name%22%3A%22requests%22%7D%5D&limit=20&time_start=2023-09-09T00%3A00%3A00Z&time_end=2023-09-17T00%3A00%3A00Z&where=%7B%22cond%22%3A%7B%22exprs%22%3A%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22device_country%22%7D%2C%7B%22val%22%3A%22US%22%7D%5D%2C%22op%22%3A%22neq%22%7D%7D)).

        One caveat: your dataset appears to have both **`US`** and **`USA`** as distinct values, plus non-country placeholders like **`000`** and **`Unknown`**—so this result is likely a **data normalization issue** rather than “United States showing up as non‑US.” If you want, I can rerun this with a stricter filter (exclude both `US` and `USA`, and optionally exclude `Unknown`/`000`) to identify the true top non‑US country.
