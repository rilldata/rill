        `auctions_metrics` is a metrics view built on the **`auctions_data`** model/table, with **`__time`** as the primary time dimension (timestamp). It’s designed to analyze **auction request volume and bid-floor dynamics** across app/site, publisher, device, and placement attributes—i.e., the “supply + request” side of the marketplace.

        ### Measures (what you can quantify)
        - **`requests`**: Total auction/bid requests, defined as `sum(bid_request_cnt)`. This is your core volume metric.
        - **`avg_bid_floor`**: Average bid floor, defined as `sum(bid_floor) / sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)` (USD currency formatting). This implies bid floors are only counted when a floor is present, and the denominator is a count of “has floor” events.
        - **`1d_qps`**: Average queries per second over a day, defined as `sum(bid_request_cnt) / 86400`. This is essentially requests normalized to a per-second rate.

        ### Dimensions (how you can slice it)
        **Time**
        - **`__time`**: Timestamp dimension. The view’s *smallest time grain* is **hour**, so hourly is the finest reliable aggregation.

        **Supply / inventory context**
        - **`app_or_site`**: App vs site indicator.
        - **`app_site_name`**, **`app_site_domain`**, **`app_site_cat`**: Inventory identity and categorization.
        - **`pub_name`**: Publisher.

        **Placement & auction configuration**
        - **`ad_size`**, **`ad_position`**, **`placement_type`**
        - **`auction_type`**
        - **`bid_floor_bucket`**: Pre-bucketed floor ranges (useful for distribution-style analysis without needing raw floors).
        - **`video_min_duration_bucket`**, **`video_max_duration_bucket`**: Video constraints buckets.

        **Device / platform / geo**
        - **`device_country`**, **`device_state`**
        - **`device_type`**, **`device_os`**, **`device_osv`**
        - **`platform_browser`**

        ### What this view is best for (typical questions)
        - Where are **requests** growing/declining (by publisher, app/site, country, device)?
        - How does **avg bid floor** vary by **inventory type** (app vs site), **placement**, or **geo**?
        - Are changes in volume driven by **mix shifts** (e.g., more traffic from a low-floor bucket, or from a specific device OS)?

        If you tell me what decision you’re trying to make (pricing floors, supply quality, geo expansion, etc.), I can suggest the most relevant cuts—still without querying—so you have a clear analysis plan before we pull any numbers.

        `auctions_metrics` is a metrics view built on the **`auctions_data`** model/table, with **`__time`** as the primary time dimension (timestamp). It’s designed to analyze **auction request volume and bid-floor dynamics** across app/site, publisher, device, and placement attributes—i.e., the “supply + request” side of the marketplace.

        ### Measures (what you can quantify)
        - **`requests`**: Total auction/bid requests, defined as `sum(bid_request_cnt)`. This is your core volume metric.
        - **`avg_bid_floor`**: Average bid floor, defined as `sum(bid_floor) / sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)` (USD currency formatting). This implies bid floors are only counted when a floor is present, and the denominator is a count of “has floor” events.
        - **`1d_qps`**: Average queries per second over a day, defined as `sum(bid_request_cnt) / 86400`. This is essentially requests normalized to a per-second rate.

        ### Dimensions (how you can slice it)
        **Time**
        - **`__time`**: Timestamp dimension. The view’s *smallest time grain* is **hour**, so hourly is the finest reliable aggregation.

        **Supply / inventory context**
        - **`app_or_site`**: App vs site indicator.
        - **`app_site_name`**, **`app_site_domain`**, **`app_site_cat`**: Inventory identity and categorization.
        - **`pub_name`**: Publisher.

        **Placement & auction configuration**
        - **`ad_size`**, **`ad_position`**, **`placement_type`**
        - **`auction_type`**
        - **`bid_floor_bucket`**: Pre-bucketed floor ranges (useful for distribution-style analysis without needing raw floors).
        - **`video_min_duration_bucket`**, **`video_max_duration_bucket`**: Video constraints buckets.

        **Device / platform / geo**
        - **`device_country`**, **`device_state`**
        - **`device_type`**, **`device_os`**, **`device_osv`**
        - **`platform_browser`**

        ### What this view is best for (typical questions)
        - Where are **requests** growing/declining (by publisher, app/site, country, device)?
        - How does **avg bid floor** vary by **inventory type** (app vs site), **placement**, or **geo**?
        - Are changes in volume driven by **mix shifts** (e.g., more traffic from a low-floor bucket, or from a specific device OS)?

        If you tell me what decision you’re trying to make (pricing floors, supply quality, geo expansion, etc.), I can suggest the most relevant cuts—still without querying—so you have a clear analysis plan before we pull any numbers.

        `bids_metrics` is a metrics view built on the **`bids_data`** model/table, with **`__time`** as the primary time dimension (timestamp). Conceptually, this is the **demand + performance** side of the marketplace: bids placed, wins/impressions, spend, and downstream engagement (clicks/video).

        ### Measures (what you can quantify)
        **Volume + delivery**
        - **`total_bids`**: `sum(bid_cnt)` — total bids submitted.
        - **`impressions`**: `sum(imp_cnt)` — total wins/impressions delivered.
        - **`win_rate`**: `sum(imp_cnt) / sum(bid_cnt)` — win rate (formatted as %).

        **Spend + pricing**
        - **`overall_spend`**: `sum(media_spend_usd)/1000` — total spend in USD (note the `/1000`, which usually indicates the raw field is in “micros” or “milli-units”).
        - **`avg_bid_price`**: `sum(bid_price_usd)/sum(bid_cnt)/1000` — average bid price in USD (also scaled by `/1000`).
        - **`ecpm`**: `sum(media_spend_usd)/1000 / sum(imp_cnt)` — effective CPM in USD.
        - **`avg_bid_floor`**: `sum(bid_floor) / sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)` — average floor when a floor exists (USD).

        **Engagement + video quality**
        - **`clicks`**: `sum(click_reg_cnt)`
        - **`ctr`**: `sum(click_reg_cnt) / sum(imp_cnt)` — click-through rate (%).
        - **`video_starts`**: `sum(video_start_cnt)`
        - **`video_completes`**: `sum(video_complete_cnt)`
        - **`video_completion_rate`**: `sum(video_complete_cnt) / sum(video_start_cnt)` — VCR (%)

        **Smoothing / trend**
        - **`bids_7day_rolling_avg`** (derived): a 7-day rolling average of `total_bids`, using a window frame of **current day + previous 6 days**, ordered by `__time`. This is useful for separating real trend from day-to-day volatility.

        ### Dimensions (how you can slice it)
        **Time**
        - **`__time`**: Timestamp; the view’s *smallest time grain* is **hour**.

        **Demand / buyer structure**
        - **`advertiser_name`**, **`adomain`**
        - **`campaign_name`**, **`line_item_name`**

        **Supply / inventory context (overlaps with auctions view)**
        - **`pub_name`**
        - **`app_or_site`**, **`app_site_name`**, **`app_site_domain`**
        - **`auction_type`**, **`placement_type`**, **`bid_floor_bucket`**

        **Creative / format / player**
        - **`creative_type`**
        - **`player_size`**
        - **`interstitial`**
        - **`video_activity`** (often indicates placement/video context or playback state)

        **Device / platform / privacy**
        - **`device_type`**, **`device_os`**, **`device_osv`**
        - **`platform_browser`**
        - **`device_region`**
        - **`privacy`** (boolean; useful for analyzing performance differences under privacy constraints)
        - **`sdk`** (helpful for diagnosing SDK-specific delivery/performance issues)

        ### What this view is best for (typical questions)
        - Which advertisers/campaigns are driving **spend** and how efficiently (eCPM, win rate)?
        - Where are you seeing **win-rate drops** (by inventory, device, region, privacy)?
        - Are engagement metrics (CTR, VCR) shifting due to **creative type**, **interstitial**, **player size**, or **SDK**?

        If you tell me whether you care most about **revenue/spend**, **win rate**, or **video quality**, I can outline a tight analysis plan (dimensions to check first, and what “red flags” to look for) before we run any queries.

        `auctions_metrics` is a metrics view built on the **`auctions_data`** model/table, with **`__time`** as the primary time dimension (timestamp). It’s designed to analyze **auction request volume and bid-floor dynamics** across app/site, publisher, device, and placement attributes—i.e., the “supply + request” side of the marketplace.

        ### Measures (what you can quantify)
        - **`requests`**: Total auction/bid requests, defined as `sum(bid_request_cnt)`. This is your core volume metric.
        - **`avg_bid_floor`**: Average bid floor, defined as `sum(bid_floor) / sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)` (USD currency formatting). This implies bid floors are only counted when a floor is present, and the denominator is a count of “has floor” events.
        - **`1d_qps`**: Average queries per second over a day, defined as `sum(bid_request_cnt) / 86400`. This is essentially requests normalized to a per-second rate.

        ### Dimensions (how you can slice it)
        **Time**
        - **`__time`**: Timestamp dimension. The view’s *smallest time grain* is **hour**, so hourly is the finest reliable aggregation.

        **Supply / inventory context**
        - **`app_or_site`**: App vs site indicator.
        - **`app_site_name`**, **`app_site_domain`**, **`app_site_cat`**: Inventory identity and categorization.
        - **`pub_name`**: Publisher.

        **Placement & auction configuration**
        - **`ad_size`**, **`ad_position`**, **`placement_type`**
        - **`auction_type`**
        - **`bid_floor_bucket`**: Pre-bucketed floor ranges (useful for distribution-style analysis without needing raw floors).
        - **`video_min_duration_bucket`**, **`video_max_duration_bucket`**: Video constraints buckets.

        **Device / platform / geo**
        - **`device_country`**, **`device_state`**
        - **`device_type`**, **`device_os`**, **`device_osv`**
        - **`platform_browser`**

        ### What this view is best for (typical questions)
        - Where are **requests** growing/declining (by publisher, app/site, country, device)?
        - How does **avg bid floor** vary by **inventory type** (app vs site), **placement**, or **geo**?
        - Are changes in volume driven by **mix shifts** (e.g., more traffic from a low-floor bucket, or from a specific device OS)?

        If you tell me what decision you’re trying to make (pricing floors, supply quality, geo expansion, etc.), I can suggest the most relevant cuts—still without querying—so you have a clear analysis plan before we pull any numbers.

        `bids_metrics` is a metrics view built on the **`bids_data`** model/table, with **`__time`** as the primary time dimension (timestamp). Conceptually, this is the **demand + performance** side of the marketplace: bids placed, wins/impressions, spend, and downstream engagement (clicks/video).

        ### Measures (what you can quantify)
        **Volume + delivery**
        - **`total_bids`**: `sum(bid_cnt)` — total bids submitted.
        - **`impressions`**: `sum(imp_cnt)` — total wins/impressions delivered.
        - **`win_rate`**: `sum(imp_cnt) / sum(bid_cnt)` — win rate (formatted as %).

        **Spend + pricing**
        - **`overall_spend`**: `sum(media_spend_usd)/1000` — total spend in USD (note the `/1000`, which usually indicates the raw field is in “micros” or “milli-units”).
        - **`avg_bid_price`**: `sum(bid_price_usd)/sum(bid_cnt)/1000` — average bid price in USD (also scaled by `/1000`).
        - **`ecpm`**: `sum(media_spend_usd)/1000 / sum(imp_cnt)` — effective CPM in USD.
        - **`avg_bid_floor`**: `sum(bid_floor) / sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)` — average floor when a floor exists (USD).

        **Engagement + video quality**
        - **`clicks`**: `sum(click_reg_cnt)`
        - **`ctr`**: `sum(click_reg_cnt) / sum(imp_cnt)` — click-through rate (%).
        - **`video_starts`**: `sum(video_start_cnt)`
        - **`video_completes`**: `sum(video_complete_cnt)`
        - **`video_completion_rate`**: `sum(video_complete_cnt) / sum(video_start_cnt)` — VCR (%)

        **Smoothing / trend**
        - **`bids_7day_rolling_avg`** (derived): a 7-day rolling average of `total_bids`, using a window frame of **current day + previous 6 days**, ordered by `__time`. This is useful for separating real trend from day-to-day volatility.

        ### Dimensions (how you can slice it)
        **Time**
        - **`__time`**: Timestamp; the view’s *smallest time grain* is **hour**.

        **Demand / buyer structure**
        - **`advertiser_name`**, **`adomain`**
        - **`campaign_name`**, **`line_item_name`**

        **Supply / inventory context (overlaps with auctions view)**
        - **`pub_name`**
        - **`app_or_site`**, **`app_site_name`**, **`app_site_domain`**
        - **`auction_type`**, **`placement_type`**, **`bid_floor_bucket`**

        **Creative / format / player**
        - **`creative_type`**
        - **`player_size`**
        - **`interstitial`**
        - **`video_activity`** (often indicates placement/video context or playback state)

        **Device / platform / privacy**
        - **`device_type`**, **`device_os`**, **`device_osv`**
        - **`platform_browser`**
        - **`device_region`**
        - **`privacy`** (boolean; useful for analyzing performance differences under privacy constraints)
        - **`sdk`** (helpful for diagnosing SDK-specific delivery/performance issues)

        ### What this view is best for (typical questions)
        - Which advertisers/campaigns are driving **spend** and how efficiently (eCPM, win rate)?
        - Where are you seeing **win-rate drops** (by inventory, device, region, privacy)?
        - Are engagement metrics (CTR, VCR) shifting due to **creative type**, **interstitial**, **player size**, or **SDK**?

        If you tell me whether you care most about **revenue/spend**, **win rate**, or **video quality**, I can outline a tight analysis plan (dimensions to check first, and what “red flags” to look for) before we run any queries.

        `auctions_metrics` is a metrics view built on the **`auctions_data`** model/table, with **`__time`** as the primary time dimension (timestamp). It’s designed to analyze **auction request volume and bid-floor dynamics** across app/site, publisher, device, and placement attributes—i.e., the “supply + request” side of the marketplace.

        ### Measures (what you can quantify)
        - **`requests`**: Total auction/bid requests, defined as `sum(bid_request_cnt)`. This is your core volume metric.
        - **`avg_bid_floor`**: Average bid floor, defined as `sum(bid_floor) / sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)` (USD currency formatting). This implies bid floors are only counted when a floor is present, and the denominator is a count of “has floor” events.
        - **`1d_qps`**: Average queries per second over a day, defined as `sum(bid_request_cnt) / 86400`. This is essentially requests normalized to a per-second rate.

        ### Dimensions (how you can slice it)
        **Time**
        - **`__time`**: Timestamp dimension. The view’s *smallest time grain* is **hour**, so hourly is the finest reliable aggregation.

        **Supply / inventory context**
        - **`app_or_site`**: App vs site indicator.
        - **`app_site_name`**, **`app_site_domain`**, **`app_site_cat`**: Inventory identity and categorization.
        - **`pub_name`**: Publisher.

        **Placement & auction configuration**
        - **`ad_size`**, **`ad_position`**, **`placement_type`**
        - **`auction_type`**
        - **`bid_floor_bucket`**: Pre-bucketed floor ranges (useful for distribution-style analysis without needing raw floors).
        - **`video_min_duration_bucket`**, **`video_max_duration_bucket`**: Video constraints buckets.

        **Device / platform / geo**
        - **`device_country`**, **`device_state`**
        - **`device_type`**, **`device_os`**, **`device_osv`**
        - **`platform_browser`**

        ### What this view is best for (typical questions)
        - Where are **requests** growing/declining (by publisher, app/site, country, device)?
        - How does **avg bid floor** vary by **inventory type** (app vs site), **placement**, or **geo**?
        - Are changes in volume driven by **mix shifts** (e.g., more traffic from a low-floor bucket, or from a specific device OS)?

        If you tell me what decision you’re trying to make (pricing floors, supply quality, geo expansion, etc.), I can suggest the most relevant cuts—still without querying—so you have a clear analysis plan before we pull any numbers.

        `bids_metrics` is a metrics view built on the **`bids_data`** model/table, with **`__time`** as the primary time dimension (timestamp). Conceptually, this is the **demand + performance** side of the marketplace: bids placed, wins/impressions, spend, and downstream engagement (clicks/video).

        ### Measures (what you can quantify)
        **Volume + delivery**
        - **`total_bids`**: `sum(bid_cnt)` — total bids submitted.
        - **`impressions`**: `sum(imp_cnt)` — total wins/impressions delivered.
        - **`win_rate`**: `sum(imp_cnt) / sum(bid_cnt)` — win rate (formatted as %).

        **Spend + pricing**
        - **`overall_spend`**: `sum(media_spend_usd)/1000` — total spend in USD (note the `/1000`, which usually indicates the raw field is in “micros” or “milli-units”).
        - **`avg_bid_price`**: `sum(bid_price_usd)/sum(bid_cnt)/1000` — average bid price in USD (also scaled by `/1000`).
        - **`ecpm`**: `sum(media_spend_usd)/1000 / sum(imp_cnt)` — effective CPM in USD.
        - **`avg_bid_floor`**: `sum(bid_floor) / sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)` — average floor when a floor exists (USD).

        **Engagement + video quality**
        - **`clicks`**: `sum(click_reg_cnt)`
        - **`ctr`**: `sum(click_reg_cnt) / sum(imp_cnt)` — click-through rate (%).
        - **`video_starts`**: `sum(video_start_cnt)`
        - **`video_completes`**: `sum(video_complete_cnt)`
        - **`video_completion_rate`**: `sum(video_complete_cnt) / sum(video_start_cnt)` — VCR (%)

        **Smoothing / trend**
        - **`bids_7day_rolling_avg`** (derived): a 7-day rolling average of `total_bids`, using a window frame of **current day + previous 6 days**, ordered by `__time`. This is useful for separating real trend from day-to-day volatility.

        ### Dimensions (how you can slice it)
        **Time**
        - **`__time`**: Timestamp; the view’s *smallest time grain* is **hour**.

        **Demand / buyer structure**
        - **`advertiser_name`**, **`adomain`**
        - **`campaign_name`**, **`line_item_name`**

        **Supply / inventory context (overlaps with auctions view)**
        - **`pub_name`**
        - **`app_or_site`**, **`app_site_name`**, **`app_site_domain`**
        - **`auction_type`**, **`placement_type`**, **`bid_floor_bucket`**

        **Creative / format / player**
        - **`creative_type`**
        - **`player_size`**
        - **`interstitial`**
        - **`video_activity`** (often indicates placement/video context or playback state)

        **Device / platform / privacy**
        - **`device_type`**, **`device_os`**, **`device_osv`**
        - **`platform_browser`**
        - **`device_region`**
        - **`privacy`** (boolean; useful for analyzing performance differences under privacy constraints)
        - **`sdk`** (helpful for diagnosing SDK-specific delivery/performance issues)

        ### What this view is best for (typical questions)
        - Which advertisers/campaigns are driving **spend** and how efficiently (eCPM, win rate)?
        - Where are you seeing **win-rate drops** (by inventory, device, region, privacy)?
        - Are engagement metrics (CTR, VCR) shifting due to **creative type**, **interstitial**, **player size**, or **SDK**?

        If you tell me whether you care most about **revenue/spend**, **win rate**, or **video quality**, I can outline a tight analysis plan (dimensions to check first, and what “red flags” to look for) before we run any queries.

        `auctions_metrics` is a metrics view built on the **`auctions_data`** model/table, with **`__time`** as the primary time dimension (timestamp). It’s designed to analyze **auction request volume and bid-floor dynamics** across app/site, publisher, device, and placement attributes—i.e., the “supply + request” side of the marketplace.

        ### Measures (what you can quantify)
        - **`requests`**: Total auction/bid requests, defined as `sum(bid_request_cnt)`. This is your core volume metric.
        - **`avg_bid_floor`**: Average bid floor, defined as `sum(bid_floor) / sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)` (USD currency formatting). This implies bid floors are only counted when a floor is present, and the denominator is a count of “has floor” events.
        - **`1d_qps`**: Average queries per second over a day, defined as `sum(bid_request_cnt) / 86400`. This is essentially requests normalized to a per-second rate.

        ### Dimensions (how you can slice it)
        **Time**
        - **`__time`**: Timestamp dimension. The view’s *smallest time grain* is **hour**, so hourly is the finest reliable aggregation.

        **Supply / inventory context**
        - **`app_or_site`**: App vs site indicator.
        - **`app_site_name`**, **`app_site_domain`**, **`app_site_cat`**: Inventory identity and categorization.
        - **`pub_name`**: Publisher.

        **Placement & auction configuration**
        - **`ad_size`**, **`ad_position`**, **`placement_type`**
        - **`auction_type`**
        - **`bid_floor_bucket`**: Pre-bucketed floor ranges (useful for distribution-style analysis without needing raw floors).
        - **`video_min_duration_bucket`**, **`video_max_duration_bucket`**: Video constraints buckets.

        **Device / platform / geo**
        - **`device_country`**, **`device_state`**
        - **`device_type`**, **`device_os`**, **`device_osv`**
        - **`platform_browser`**

        ### What this view is best for (typical questions)
        - Where are **requests** growing/declining (by publisher, app/site, country, device)?
        - How does **avg bid floor** vary by **inventory type** (app vs site), **placement**, or **geo**?
        - Are changes in volume driven by **mix shifts** (e.g., more traffic from a low-floor bucket, or from a specific device OS)?

        If you tell me what decision you’re trying to make (pricing floors, supply quality, geo expansion, etc.), I can suggest the most relevant cuts—still without querying—so you have a clear analysis plan before we pull any numbers.

        `bids_metrics` is a metrics view built on the **`bids_data`** model/table, with **`__time`** as the primary time dimension (timestamp). Conceptually, this is the **demand + performance** side of the marketplace: bids placed, wins/impressions, spend, and downstream engagement (clicks/video).

        ### Measures (what you can quantify)
        **Volume + delivery**
        - **`total_bids`**: `sum(bid_cnt)` — total bids submitted.
        - **`impressions`**: `sum(imp_cnt)` — total wins/impressions delivered.
        - **`win_rate`**: `sum(imp_cnt) / sum(bid_cnt)` — win rate (formatted as %).

        **Spend + pricing**
        - **`overall_spend`**: `sum(media_spend_usd)/1000` — total spend in USD (note the `/1000`, which usually indicates the raw field is in “micros” or “milli-units”).
        - **`avg_bid_price`**: `sum(bid_price_usd)/sum(bid_cnt)/1000` — average bid price in USD (also scaled by `/1000`).
        - **`ecpm`**: `sum(media_spend_usd)/1000 / sum(imp_cnt)` — effective CPM in USD.
        - **`avg_bid_floor`**: `sum(bid_floor) / sum(has_bid_floor_cnt)` — average floor when a floor exists (USD).

        **Engagement + video quality**
        - **`clicks`**: `sum(click_reg_cnt)`
        - **`ctr`**: `sum(click_reg_cnt) / sum(imp_cnt)` — click-through rate (%).
        - **`video_starts`**: `sum(video_start_cnt)`
        - **`video_completes`**: `sum(video_complete_cnt)`
        - **`video_completion_rate`**: `sum(video_complete_cnt) / sum(video_start_cnt)` — VCR (%)

        **Smoothing / trend**
        - **`bids_7day_rolling_avg`** (derived): a 7-day rolling average of `total_bids`, using a window frame of **current day + previous 6 days**, ordered by `__time`. This is useful for separating real trend from day-to-day volatility.

        ### Dimensions (how you can slice it)
        **Time**
        - **`__time`**: Timestamp; the view’s *smallest time grain* is **hour**.

        **Demand / buyer structure**
        - **`advertiser_name`**, **`adomain`**
        - **`campaign_name`**, **`line_item_name`**

        **Supply / inventory context (overlaps with auctions view)**
        - **`pub_name`**
        - **`app_or_site`**, **`app_site_name`**, **`app_site_domain`**
        - **`auction_type`**, **`placement_type`**, **`bid_floor_bucket`**

        **Creative / format / player**
        - **`creative_type`**
        - **`player_size`**
        - **`interstitial`**
        - **`video_activity`** (often indicates placement/video context or playback state)

        **Device / platform / privacy**
        - **`device_type`**, **`device_os`**, **`device_osv`**
        - **`platform_browser`**
        - **`device_region`**
        - **`privacy`** (boolean; useful for analyzing performance differences under privacy constraints)
        - **`sdk`** (helpful for diagnosing SDK-specific delivery/performance issues)

        ### What this view is best for (typical questions)
        - Which advertisers/campaigns are driving **spend** and how efficiently (eCPM, win rate)?
        - Where are you seeing **win-rate drops** (by inventory, device, region, privacy)?
        - Are engagement metrics (CTR, VCR) shifting due to **creative type**, **interstitial**, **player size**, or **SDK**?

        If you tell me whether you care most about **revenue/spend**, **win rate**, or **video quality**, I can outline a tight analysis plan (dimensions to check first, and what “red flags” to look for) before we run any queries.
