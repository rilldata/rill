        The Auctions Metrics view provides a comprehensive set of dimensions and measures for analyzing auction-level data. Here’s what you can explore:

        ### Measures (Quantitative Metrics)
        - **Requests**: Total number of bid requests.
        - **Avg Bid Floor**: Average bid floor price (in USD).
        - **1D Qps**: Average queries per second over a day.

        ### Dimensions (Breakdown Options)
        You can segment the data by:
        - App/site details: Name, domain, category, app or site
        - Publisher name
        - Ad characteristics: Size, position, placement type, auction type
        - Device details: State, OS, OS version, type, country, browser
        - Bid floor bucket
        - Video duration buckets (min/max)

        The default time dimension is at the hourly level, so you can analyze trends over time with fine granularity.

        Would you like to see a summary of the available data (such as the time range and sample values), or should I start analyzing specific auction metrics right away?

        The Auctions Metrics view provides a comprehensive set of dimensions and measures for analyzing auction-level data. Here’s what you can explore:

        ### Measures (Quantitative Metrics)
        - **Requests**: Total number of bid requests.
        - **Avg Bid Floor**: Average bid floor price (in USD).
        - **1D Qps**: Average queries per second over a day.

        ### Dimensions (Breakdown Options)
        You can segment the data by:
        - App/site details: Name, domain, category, app or site
        - Publisher name
        - Ad characteristics: Size, position, placement type, auction type
        - Device details: State, OS, OS version, type, country, browser
        - Bid floor bucket
        - Video duration buckets (min/max)

        The default time dimension is at the hourly level, so you can analyze trends over time with fine granularity.

        Would you like to see a summary of the available data (such as the time range and sample values), or should I start analyzing specific auction metrics right away?

        The Auctions Metrics view provides a comprehensive set of dimensions and measures for analyzing auction-level data. Here’s what you can explore:

        ### Measures (Quantitative Metrics)
        - **Requests**: Total number of bid requests.
        - **Avg Bid Floor**: Average bid floor price (in USD).
        - **1D Qps**: Average queries per second over a day.

        ### Dimensions (Breakdown Options)
        You can segment the data by:
        - App/site details: Name, domain, category, app or site
        - Publisher name
        - Ad characteristics: Size, position, placement type, auction type
        - Device details: State, OS, OS version, type, country, browser
        - Bid floor bucket
        - Video duration buckets (min/max)

        The default time dimension is at the hourly level, so you can analyze trends over time with fine granularity.

        Would you like to see a summary of the available data (such as the time range and sample values), or should I start analyzing specific auction metrics right away?

        The Bids Metrics view offers a rich set of measures and dimensions for analyzing bid-level performance. Here’s what you can explore:

        ### Measures (Quantitative Metrics)
        - Overall Spend (USD)
        - Total Bids
        - Impressions
        - Win Rate (Impressions / Bids)
        - Clicks
        - CTR (Click Through Rate)
        - Video Starts & Completes
        - Video Completion Rate
        - Avg Bid Price (USD)
        - eCPM (Effective Cost per Mille)
        - Avg Bid Floor (USD)
        - Bids 7-Day Rolling Average

        ### Dimensions (Breakdown Options)
        You can segment the data by:
        - Advertiser and campaign: Advertiser name, campaign name, line item name, adomain
        - App/site details: Name, domain, app or site
        - Auction and ad details: Auction type, bid floor bucket, creative type, placement type, interstitial, player size, video activity
        - Device: OS, OS version, type, region, browser, SDK
        - Publisher name
        - Privacy flag

        The default time dimension is also at the hourly level, enabling detailed time-based analysis.

        Would you like a summary of the available data (such as the time range and sample values), or should I begin analyzing specific bid metrics right away?

        Great question! To answer this, I’ll look at the Auctions Metrics dataset, since it includes device_country as a dimension and requests as a measure. I’ll summarize total requests by country, exclude the US, and identify which non-US country has the highest activity.

        First, I’ll check the available time range to ensure the analysis covers all data.

        1. Auctions Metrics
        2. Bids Metrics

        These datasets likely cover auction-level and bid-level analytics. Next, I’ll dig into the structure of each to understand what measures and dimensions are available for analysis. Would you like me to start with Auctions Metrics or Bids Metrics?

        Great question! To answer this, I’ll look at the Auctions Metrics dataset, since it includes device_country as a dimension and requests as a measure. I’ll summarize total requests by country, exclude the US, and identify which non-US country has the highest activity.

        First, I’ll check the available time range to ensure the analysis covers all data.

        1. Auctions Metrics
        2. Bids Metrics

        These datasets likely cover auction-level and bid-level analytics. Next, I’ll dig into the structure of each to understand what measures and dimensions are available for analysis. Would you like me to start with Auctions Metrics or Bids Metrics?

        The Auctions Metrics view provides a comprehensive set of dimensions and measures for analyzing auction-level data. Here’s what you can explore:

        ### Measures (Quantitative Metrics)
        - **Requests**: Total number of bid requests.
        - **Avg Bid Floor**: Average bid floor price (in USD).
        - **1D Qps**: Average queries per second over a day.

        ### Dimensions (Breakdown Options)
        You can segment the data by:
        - App/site details: Name, domain, category, app or site
        - Publisher name
        - Ad characteristics: Size, position, placement type, auction type
        - Device details: State, OS, OS version, type, country, browser
        - Bid floor bucket
        - Video duration buckets (min/max)

        The default time dimension is at the hourly level, so you can analyze trends over time with fine granularity.

        Would you like to see a summary of the available data (such as the time range and sample values), or should I start analyzing specific auction metrics right away?

        Based on the available data, the non-US country with the most auction activity is "000" with 34,886,200 requests. However, it's important to note that "000" and "Unknown" are likely placeholder or unclassified country codes, not actual countries. No specific non-US country (like CA, GB, IN, etc.) appears in the top results, which suggests either the data is heavily US-centric or country classification is incomplete for non-US traffic ([see country activity breakdown](https://app.rilldata.com/dashboards/auctions_metrics?country_exclude=US)).

        If you want, I can dig deeper to find the top actual non-US country (excluding placeholders and "Unknown"). Would you like me to do that?
