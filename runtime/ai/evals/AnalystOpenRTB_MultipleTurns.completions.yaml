        The Auctions Metrics view provides a comprehensive set of dimensions and measures to analyze auction activity. Here’s what you can explore:

        Measures (Key Metrics):
        - Requests: The total number of bid requests, giving you a sense of auction volume.
        - Avg Bid Floor: The average bid floor price, calculated as the sum of bid floors divided by the count of auctions with a bid floor. This helps you understand pricing thresholds.
        - 1D Qps: The average number of requests per second over a day (QPS = queries per second), useful for assessing system load and traffic peaks.

        Dimensions (Ways to Segment the Data):
        - App/Site details: Name, domain, category, and whether it’s an app or site.
        - Publisher info: Publisher name.
        - Ad characteristics: Ad size, ad position, placement type, auction type.
        - Device info: Device type, OS, OS version, browser, state, and country.
        - Video details: Maximum and minimum duration buckets.
        - Bid floor bucket: Allows grouping by bid floor ranges.

        Time granularity is available down to the hour, so you can analyze trends and patterns at a fine level.

        This view is ideal for understanding where, how, and under what conditions auctions are happening, as well as identifying opportunities to optimize auction performance or spot anomalies. If you’d like to start analyzing, let me know your business priorities or questions!

        The Auctions Metrics view provides a comprehensive set of dimensions and measures to analyze auction activity. Here’s what you can explore:

        Measures (Key Metrics):
        - Requests: The total number of bid requests, giving you a sense of auction volume.
        - Avg Bid Floor: The average bid floor price, calculated as the sum of bid floors divided by the count of auctions with a bid floor. This helps you understand pricing thresholds.
        - 1D Qps: The average number of requests per second over a day (QPS = queries per second), useful for assessing system load and traffic peaks.

        Dimensions (Ways to Segment the Data):
        - App/Site details: Name, domain, category, and whether it’s an app or site.
        - Publisher info: Publisher name.
        - Ad characteristics: Ad size, ad position, placement type, auction type.
        - Device info: Device type, OS, OS version, browser, state, and country.
        - Video details: Maximum and minimum duration buckets.
        - Bid floor bucket: Allows grouping by bid floor ranges.

        Time granularity is available down to the hour, so you can analyze trends and patterns at a fine level.

        This view is ideal for understanding where, how, and under what conditions auctions are happening, as well as identifying opportunities to optimize auction performance or spot anomalies. If you’d like to start analyzing, let me know your business priorities or questions!

        There are two metrics views available in this project:

        1. Auctions Metrics
        2. Bids Metrics

        These datasets likely cover auction-level and bid-level analytics. Next, I’ll dive deeper into each to understand what measures and dimensions are available for analysis. If you have a preference for which to start with, let me know! Otherwise, I’ll begin with Auctions Metrics.

        The Bids Metrics dataset offers a detailed view of bidding and campaign performance, with a wide range of measures and segmentation options. Here’s what you can analyze:

        Measures (Key Metrics):
        - Overall Spend: Total media spend in USD (in thousands).
        - Total Bids: The count of bids placed.
        - Impressions: Number of impressions won.
        - Win Rate: The ratio of impressions to bids, showing how often bids are successful.
        - Clicks & CTR: Total clicks and click-through rate for engagement analysis.
        - Video Metrics: Video starts, completes, and completion rate.
        - Avg Bid Price & Avg Bid Floor: Average bid price and floor price, both in USD.
        - eCPM: Effective cost per thousand impressions.
        - Bids 7-Day Rolling Avg: A time-based rolling average of bids for trend analysis.

        Dimensions (Ways to Segment the Data):
        - Advertiser, campaign, and line item details.
        - App/site info: Name, domain, app or site.
        - Auction and placement types, creative type, interstitial status.
        - Device details: Type, OS, OS version, region, browser, SDK.
        - Video activity and player size.
        - Publisher name and privacy flag.
        - Bid floor bucket for grouping by price thresholds.

        You can analyze this data at an hourly granularity, making it possible to spot trends, outliers, or performance shifts quickly. This view is ideal for optimizing bidding strategies, understanding campaign effectiveness, and identifying opportunities to improve win rates or reduce costs.

        If you want to dive into specific business questions or performance drivers, let me know your priorities!

        There are two metrics views available in this project:

        1. Auctions Metrics
        2. Bids Metrics

        These datasets likely cover auction-level and bid-level analytics. Next, I’ll dive deeper into each to understand what measures and dimensions are available for analysis. If you have a preference for which to start with, let me know! Otherwise, I’ll begin with Auctions Metrics.

        The Auctions Metrics view provides a comprehensive set of dimensions and measures to analyze auction activity. Here’s what you can explore:

        Measures (Key Metrics):
        - Requests: The total number of bid requests, giving you a sense of auction volume.
        - Avg Bid Floor: The average bid floor price, calculated as the sum of bid floors divided by the count of auctions with a bid floor. This helps you understand pricing thresholds.
        - 1D Qps: The average number of requests per second over a day (QPS = queries per second), useful for assessing system load and traffic peaks.

        Dimensions (Ways to Segment the Data):
        - App/Site details: Name, domain, category, and whether it’s an app or site.
        - Publisher info: Publisher name.
        - Ad characteristics: Ad size, ad position, placement type, auction type.
        - Device info: Device type, OS, OS version, browser, state, and country.
        - Video details: Maximum and minimum duration buckets.
        - Bid floor bucket: Allows grouping by bid floor ranges.

        Time granularity is available down to the hour, so you can analyze trends and patterns at a fine level.

        This view is ideal for understanding where, how, and under what conditions auctions are happening, as well as identifying opportunities to optimize auction performance or spot anomalies. If you’d like to start analyzing, let me know your business priorities or questions!

        The Bids Metrics dataset offers a detailed view of bidding and campaign performance, with a wide range of measures and segmentation options. Here’s what you can analyze:

        Measures (Key Metrics):
        - Overall Spend: Total media spend in USD (in thousands).
        - Total Bids: The count of bids placed.
        - Impressions: Number of impressions won.
        - Win Rate: The ratio of impressions to bids, showing how often bids are successful.
        - Clicks & CTR: Total clicks and click-through rate for engagement analysis.
        - Video Metrics: Video starts, completes, and completion rate.
        - Avg Bid Price & Avg Bid Floor: Average bid price and floor price, both in USD.
        - eCPM: Effective cost per thousand impressions.
        - Bids 7-Day Rolling Avg: A time-based rolling average of bids for trend analysis.

        Dimensions (Ways to Segment the Data):
        - Advertiser, campaign, and line item details.
        - App/site info: Name, domain, app or site.
        - Auction and placement types, creative type, interstitial status.
        - Device details: Type, OS, OS version, region, browser, SDK.

        There are two metrics views available in this project:

        1. Auctions Metrics
        2. Bids Metrics

        These datasets likely cover auction-level and bid-level analytics. Next, I’ll dive deeper into each to understand what measures and dimensions are available for analysis. If you have a preference for which to start with, let me know! Otherwise, I’ll begin with Auctions Metrics.

        The Auctions Metrics view provides a comprehensive set of dimensions and measures to analyze auction activity. Here’s what you can explore:

        Measures (Key Metrics):
        - Requests: The total number of bid requests, giving you a sense of auction volume.
        - Avg Bid Floor: The average bid floor price, calculated as the sum of bid floors divided by the count of auctions with a bid floor. This helps you understand pricing thresholds.
        - 1D Qps: The average number of requests per second over a day (QPS = queries per second), useful for assessing system load and traffic peaks.

        Dimensions (Ways to Segment the Data):
        - App/Site details: Name, domain, category, and whether it’s an app or site.
        - Publisher info: Publisher name.
        - Ad characteristics: Ad size, ad position, placement type, auction type.
        - Device info: Device type, OS, OS version, browser, state, and country.
        - Video details: Maximum and minimum duration buckets.
        - Bid floor bucket: Allows grouping by bid floor ranges.

        Time granularity is available down to the hour, so you can analyze trends and patterns at a fine level.

        This view is ideal for understanding where, how, and under what conditions auctions are happening, as well as identifying opportunities to optimize auction performance or spot anomalies. If you’d like to start analyzing, let me know your business priorities or questions!

      content: "Based on the available data, the non-US country with the most auctions is represented by the code \"000,\" with 34,886,200 auction requests during the period analyzed. However, this code may indicate an unknown or unclassified country rather than a specific nation. If you are looking for a specific country outside the US, the dataset does not provide a clear non-US country with a higher auction count than this \"000\" code ([Country breakdown](https://app.rilldata.com/v/auctions_metrics/metrics?dimensions=device_country&measures=requests&timeRange=2023-09-09T00:00:00Z~2023-09-16T00:00:00Z&sort=requests&desc=true)). \n\nIf you want to exclude ambiguous codes and focus only on recognized country names, let me know and I can refine the analysis!"
