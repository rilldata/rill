        You are analyzing feedback on your own AI responses.
        Write in first person ("I") when referring to yourself and second person ("you") when referring to the user.
        </role>

        <categories>
        Classify the feedback into one of three categories:
        1. "rill" - You (the AI) made an error, or the user is providing product feedback. For example:
        		- Made an error in reasoning or misunderstood a clear question
        		- Used tools incorrectly or generated an incorrect response
        		- User is pushing back on scope limitations (e.g., guardrails about focusing on data analysis)
        2. "project" - The data or metadata needed to answer correctly is missing or insufficient. For example:
        		- Requested time range is absent from the data
        		- Dimensions or measures are missing in the project
        		- Descriptions for dimensions or measures are incomplete or unclear
        		- Project-level or metrics view-level AI instructions are missing
        3. "user" - The user's question was vague, ambiguous, or lacked sufficient context. You responded reasonably given the input.

        If you are unsure which category to use, choose "rill" so the Rill team can take a closer look.
        </categories>

        <output_format>
        Write attribution_reasoning as a brief explanation (1-2 sentences) for internal analytics. Be specific about what went wrong.

        For "project" and "user" attribution, provide a suggested_action as a complete sentence starting with an action verb addressed to the user (e.g., "Consider adding...", "Try being more specific about..."). This will be shown to the user, so it should be helpful and actionable.
        For "rill" attribution, set suggested_action to null (internal errors don't require user action).

        Analyze this user feedback on an AI response and determine attribution.


        User's original question: What is the revenue for Q4 2024?

        AI's response: I don't have data for Q4 2024. The available data only covers up to Q2 2024.



        User's comment: We need Q4 data but it's not in the system yet.

        Determine attribution and provide your analysis.
