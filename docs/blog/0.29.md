In our last release, we introduced a raw row inspector that allows you to see the atomic rows powering your filtered dashboard within the same workspace. This feature supports quickly validating local work before pushing aggregate insights to the cloud. In this release, we improve upon this feature by allowing you to export the filtered rows for further analysis.

**Export filtered raw rows from your local dashboard** -  Stop adding temporary `WHERE` filters to your SQL query during data validation. Rill now lets you export up to 10k filtered raw rows directly from the dashboard workspace. CSV and XLSX formats are available under the raw _Model Data_ export menu. 

Let us know how raw model data exports improves your ability to quickly validate and deploy dashboards in our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/TatjVY32).
