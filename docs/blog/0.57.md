## Introducing the flat table
While pivot tables are great, sometimes you just need a simple, straightforward table of data. Starting today, you can toggle between nested and flat modes for your table, making it easy to switch between a pivoted view and a flat view. In flat mode, you can freely arrange measures and dimensions interchangeably, giving you more flexibility in organizing your data.
