## Developer Agent

The Developer Agent is now enabled by default in Rill! This AI-powered coding assistant helps you build dashboards, write SQL, and debug issues directly in your development workflow. 
It's also a great tool to quickly generate demo data to prototype dashboards!

## Dashboard Chat Context

Chat in Rill Cloud now has access to full dashboard context, including filters, time ranges, and dimension selections. This allows AI to provide more relevant and accurate responses based on exactly what you're viewing in your dashboard.

## MCP OAuth Authentication

We've added OAuth support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), making it easier and more secure to connect Rill with AI assistants like Claude Desktop. The new OAuth flow includes detailed setup instructions and improved authentication handling for a seamless integration experience.

## New navigation event for the iframe API
Added a new `navigation` event to help you track user navigation between dashboards when embedding Rill.

## DuckDB 1.4.2

Rill now runs on DuckDB 1.4.2, bringing the latest performance improvements, bug fixes, and features from the DuckDB team. This upgrade ensures better query performance and enhanced compatibility with modern data formats.
