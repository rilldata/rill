# Rill 0.77 - Explain Anomalies, Add Context for AI Chat, DAG Viewer and More!

:::note
⚡ **Rill Developer** lets you transform datasets with SQL and build fast, exploratory dashboards. **Rill Cloud** enables collaboration at scale.

👉 [Install Rill Developer](/get-started/install) • [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/2ubRfjC7Rh) • [Deploy to Rill Cloud](/deploy/deploy-dashboard)
:::

## Explain Anomalies

You can now highlight a time range in an Explore dashboard and have the AI explain anomalies in that time period. This is useful to quickly gain insights into drops or increases in metrics and get a detailed summary as to why a metric is moving in a certain direction.

## Dashboard Chat Context

Chat in Rill Cloud now has access to full dashboard context, including filters, time ranges, and dimension selections. This allows AI to provide more relevant and accurate responses based on exactly what you're viewing in your dashboard.

## Test Data in Rill Developer

We have made it possible to generate test data using AI when working in Rill Developer. This is super useful to quickly get up and running, prototype a dashboard, or test out a new feature with demo data!

## MCP OAuth Authentication

We've added OAuth support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), making it easier and more secure to connect Rill with AI assistants like Claude Desktop. The new OAuth flow includes detailed setup instructions and improved authentication handling for a seamless integration experience.

## DAG Viewer
We have added a dependency graph viewer that allows you to easily visualize the dependencies within a project to understand how changes to a model could affect downstream metrics views.

## New Navigation Event for the Iframe API
Added a new `navigation` event to help you track user navigation between dashboards when embedding Rill.

## DuckDB 1.4.2

Rill now runs on DuckDB 1.4.2, bringing the latest performance improvements, bug fixes, and features from the DuckDB team. This upgrade ensures better query performance and enhanced compatibility with modern data formats.
