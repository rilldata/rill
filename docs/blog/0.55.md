# Rill 0.55 - Custom logos, refresh sources in Rill Cloud, quick add in Pivot, banners and monthly reports!

:::note
âš¡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create fast, exploratory dashboards. Rill Cloud can then help to enable shared collaboration at scale.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/home/install) and [join us over on Discord](https://bit.ly/3bbcSl9) to meet the team behind the product as well as other users. In addition, once you have a project set up in Rill Developer, you can then [deploy the project](/deploy/deploy-dashboard) and collaborate with others / invite your team members by [logging into Rill Cloud](https://ui.rilldata.com)!

We have been busy! In between shipping new features and bug fixes we managed to squeeze in a trip to Amsterdam to attend DuckCon #6, thanks to everyone we had the pleasure to chat with and to DuckDB for a great event!

## Custom logos
You can now replace the Rill logo in Rill Cloud with your own! Either upload a new logo using the UI or via the cli.
And yes, we do support gifs (with a hard g). But remember, with great power comes great responsibility...

## Refresh sources in Rill Cloud
You now have even more fine grained control over source refresh in Rill Cloud directly from within the UI. Either refresh all sources or trigger a refresh of individual sources with just the click of a button.

## Quick add in Pivot
We all love drag-n-drop but sometimes you just want to go fast. When hovering over dimensions and measures you now have quick add actions to quickly add them to either columns or rows.

## Banners!
We have added a new `banner` property to the explore yaml. This allows you to display a banner in your dashboard when deployed to Rill Cloud, useful if you want to indicate a warning message or to let your users know that the dashboard is under development for example.

## Monthly report schedules
You can now send reports on a monthly schedule! That's it.
