# Rill 0.20 – Experimental features for Rill Cloud

:::note
⚡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create powerful, opinionated dashboards.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/home/install) and [let us know over on Discord](https://discord.gg/TatjVY32) if you encounter any problems or have ideas about how to improve Rill Developer!

In 2022 we were excited to bring the secret of Rill to the world - we created an open source offering that helps everyone transform their data into a rich source of truth that powers an interactive dashboard. Today, Rill Developer operates as a locally hosted application under the security perimeter of your laptop, however that makes the results difficult to share with your collaborators and prospects. As more people experience the magic of opinionated metrics, we are hearing from our users that they wish there was some way to get these endpoints _online_. In this release we take the first steps to create a consumption-based hosted version of Rill. These features are all experimental and you won't feel it yet in the product unless you look closely, but expect big things to come in the next few weeks! 

- **Dashboards First —**  An experimental feature that allows you to launch Rill in a consumption mode that does not include sources or models and does not let you edit the data to dashboard pipeline. To try consumption mode, add this CLI flag to your `rill start` command:
    
    ```
    rill start --project="my/project" --readonly
    ```

- **Materializing OBTs —**  Sometimes it the dashboard can be slow to load because it depends on upstream models that are all running views on data and do not materialize the final table. To help make this experience snappier, we have included a way to indicate that you want to materialize the model. This experience currently breaks keystroke-by-keystroke feedback and we only recommend using it once your transformation is fully baked.
    
    ```
    -- @materialize: true

    FROM my_one_big_table ...
    ```

- **Better Data Ingestion with Globs —** An experimental feature that allows you to pull in partitioned data. This work will be very important when you are running Rill in a cloud environment where the data is Enterprise-Scale and parquet files are saved in a data store. This feature will be included in our documentation once we better understand glob dynamics at scale, but if you want to try the functionality today, try these steps:

    - Open the sources modal and navigate to remote sources.
    - Enter the URL for remote source changing the parts of the path where you want to capture all of the files with a wildcard. Example:
    
    ```
    s3://ookla-open-data/parquet/performance/type=fixed/year=2022/*/*.parquet
    ```

    - Enter the correct region for the bucket if you are on s3.
    - Add the source and wait for the data to ingest - be careful this might take a while and error out if it is a lot of data! If you get stuck, kill the server in the terminal and delete the underlying [project files](../../reference/project-files).

Do you want to host your dashboard online and can't wait for our official launch? Glob patterns seem like a great idea, but this methodology doesn't work for you? [Reach out to us](https://discord.gg/TatjVY32) and we would love to learn more and help you get started!
