## Introducing AI Agents for Rill

We've been working hard over the last couple of months to bring an agentic AI workflow to Rill. Building on our existing MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration, we're now introducing project-wide chat in Rill, which is our first interactive agent of many to come.

The project agent helps you quickly analyze data, ask open-ended questions, and have the AI spot patterns and anomalies in your datasets. But it's not just a chatbot—you always have a dashboard ready to back up any responses from the AI. With just a click, you can augment the AI's insights with your own knowledge, truly bringing machine and human intelligence together.
