This release has lots of refinements to the Dashboard's concept of time to help you understand how measures and segments are changing. In addition, we have added a few features that will help us deepen our relationship with folks that are deploying local Rill projects to the cloud. 



**It's about time** - People need a solid, intuitive understanding of the dynamics and controls of timeseries data in Rill dashboards. Good controls often fade into the background - you don't want to think too much about how to understand the concept of time, you want to understand temporal _insights_. With this in mind, we took a close look at the way our dashboard exposed time controls and have updated the feel to make it clear and simple to get the view you need to be successful.
- **Show incomplete data points in the dashboard** - Different businesses have different needs around understanding the latest moment in time. Because it is _currently occuring_, oftentimes the most recent data that could be computed is not yet complete (example: it is only 11 am but you want to see a roll up for today). As an opinionated product, we had made the decision to not present this point in time because there is not complete information, but we found in practice it was not intuitive and many people are very focused on the latest data to understand what is actively happening. In this release we refined time ranges to always include all data, including the latest period.
- **Enable most time ranges to be selectable** - Similarly to showing the last point in time, people want to select any time ranges where some data exists, even if that time range might be considered incomplete. This update to our logic ensures you can select ranges of time where there is at least one data point. 
- **Ability to hide measures and dimensions from the dashboard** - When you design your dashboard metrics, you can include as many dimensions and measures as you want. Sometimes the amount of information is overwhelming and you want to focus on a particular set of measures and dimensions dynamically without removing the ability to generate them. This release includes a new feature that allows you to show and hide dimensions from the dashboard while preserving the options to reveal them in your configuration.
- **Custom date range picker** - We heard from our customers that the customer date range picker was too hard to use. Most people want to be able to use the keyboard to enter the data and the point-and-click calendar interface had tiny targets to click and you couldn't see start and end times together. In short, it was too hard to select the meaningful custom period of time. In this release we improve the custom date picker by combining start and end points with much click and type clearer interactions.
- **Support custom comparison ranges for ‘all-time’** - Rill now lets you compare any moment in time to 'all time'. For example, I might want to know the all-time new-user retention rate compared to the last month.
- **Improve time range aliases in the time range selector** - We updated the labels of our comparisons menu to make it clearer what kind of comparison is being made. 

**Welcoming YOU to Rill!** -  We are so excited to see Rill users deploying their projects to the cloud and we want to make sure you are able to successfully share your work. Accounts help you protect your work and share a view-only version with your trusted colleagues. To this end, we have added a few features to help us say hello and understand successes and failures to deploy.
- **User Emails** - When you sign up for Rill you will receive a welcome email helping you understand the account you created and the users that are engaged with your cloud project.
- **Add user_id to our analytics** - This identifier helps us understand that you have successfully logged in to our platform. We want to make sure everyone that wants to create an account can do so and tracking logins can help us debug what is going on.

**Filtered raw rows in local development dashboard** -  We now expose the raw rows powering a dashboard filtered using the include/exclude toggles when you run Rill locally. You can find the feature in a drop down at the bottom of your dashboard. Our customers have let us know how useful this feature can be for building trust and validating the data that is powering your dashboard.
