## Axis control
You can now control the axis range for charts in Canvas. This is useful when you want to limit, for example, the maximum value to synchronize chart axes.

<img src = '/img/axis.png' class='rounded-gif' />

## Dimension limits
When coloring a chart by dimension you now have access to limit and null controls!

<img src = '/img/axis.png' class='rounded-gif' />
