## New Kid on the Block: Canvas Dashboards! üñåÔ∏è
We‚Äôre proud to introduce the beta version of a brand-new dashboard type in Rill ‚Äî Canvas dashboards!

While our auto-generated Explore dashboards let you effortlessly explore, slice-and-dice, and interact with your data, we've heard the need for more traditional dashboards. That‚Äôs where Canvas dashboards come in! They allow you to easily assemble dashboards that visualize data from multiple metric views.

Canvas dashboards share many of the same powerful features as Explore, including:
- A global filtering experience
- The ability to embed dashboards
- Reuse of existing dimension and measure definitions

For our beta release, you can create Canvas dashboards containing:
- KPIs featuring key measures
- Bar and stacked bar charts
- Line and area charts
- Tables
- Markdown text components
- Images

Canvas dashboards are a fantastic complement to your existing deployment, enabling you to build scorecards, high-level reports, or consolidated metric views ‚Äî all in one place.

Happy building! :rocket:
