## ✨ Pie, Donut, and Heatmap Charts for Canvas Dashboards
We're expanding your visualization toolkit in **Canvas Dashboards** with three powerful new chart types:

### 🥧 Pie Charts
Great for showing **part-to-whole relationships** at a glance. Ideal when you have a small number of categories and want to emphasize proportionality — like sales by region or traffic source breakdowns.

### 🍩 Donut Charts
Similar to pie charts, but with a **center cutout** that improves readability and makes room for **central labels or KPIs**. Best used when you want a cleaner look or to display a key metric in the middle.

### 🔥 Heatmaps
Perfect for spotting **patterns, concentrations, or anomalies** across two dimensions — such as time vs. activity, product vs. region, or weekday vs. hour. Use heatmaps when you're working with dense data and want a quick overview of distribution.

These additions help you tell richer stories with your data and offer more flexibility when designing Canvas dashboards for your team or stakeholders.


## 🔥 Breaking Change: Dashboards Now Prioritize Your Last State
We’ve updated how deployed Rill dashboards load in Rill Cloud. Dashboards will now prioritize restoring the state you last used, while still respecting developer-defined configurations.

When opening a dashboard:

1. **Your most recent state** is restored first - ensuring your metrics and dimension order, visibility and time settings are applied.
2. Any **missing settings** are filled in from the **“Home” bookmark**, if one has been configured.
3. If needed, remaining gaps fall back to **YAML defaults** defined by the developer.

This new behavior ensures your personal preferences come first, while still honoring any team-level or default settings.
