# Rill 0.50 - UI for editing measures and dimensions, metrics layer and Rill Cloud settings.

:::note
⚡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create fast, exploratory dashboards. Rill Cloud can then help to enable shared collaboration at scale.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/get-started/install) and [join us over on Discord](https://discord.gg/2ubRfjC7Rh) to meet the team behind the product as well as other users. In addition, once you have a project set up in Rill Developer, you can then [deploy the project](/deploy/deploy-dashboard) and collaborate with others / invite your team members by [logging into Rill Cloud](https://ui.rilldata.com)!

## Creating Measures and Dimensions, visually!

We have introduced a visual way to create and edit metrics and dimensions in Rill Developer. With just a few clicks you can now add or edit measures and dimensions without having to write a single line of code! We are super excited to bring measure and dimesions creation to users that aren't familiar with yaml and we can't wait to extend the same editing experience to Rill Cloud.
Don't worry, yaml and code artifacts aren't going away and you can easily toggle between code and UI.

## Metrics Layer

Your dashboards has always contained definitions for dimensions and measures, as Rill continues to grow we have seperated the metrics view from visual dashboard config. This comes with a lot of benefits such as being able to have multiple dashboards reference the same metrics view. In addition it will make the semantics of Rill easier to understand as APIs and other features now references a metrics view rather then a dashboard. Your old dashboard files will continue to work but it's encouraged to migrate at your earliest convenience. 

## Settings page

You can now manage your Rill Cloud settings, such as name and allow list domains, directly from within the Rill Cloud UI. More settings to come!
