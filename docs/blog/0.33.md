## Unlock More Granular Dashboard Access with Advanced Security Policies! 🛡️
Advanced security policies give you more control over dashboard access. Here’s what’s new:

- **Dashboard Access**: Handpick who can view specific dashboards.

- **Row-Level Access**: Use SQL filters to define which rows a user has access to.

- **Selective Column Visibility**: Choose to include or exclude dimensions and measures based on who is viewing the dashboard.

- **Mock users for easy testing**: When developing locally, enable mock users to test your new granular security policies. Simply add them in your project’s rill.yaml file, then select them using the "View as" button on the dashboard.
  This lets you see what each user would see based on the policies you set.

### Imagine the Possibilities: Configure Access by Team, Department, and Even External Partners 🌟
- **Team-specific Dashboards**: You can now define team or department specific data access rules on dashboards.
- **Partner Dashboards**: Collaborating with external partners? Generate custom dashboards where external stakeholders only see the data directly relevant to them—no more, no less.
