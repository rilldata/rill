# Rill 0.64 - Export metadata headers, search in Pivot pills, User groups when sharing and more

:::note
âš¡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create fast, exploratory dashboards. Rill Cloud can then help enable shared collaboration at scale.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/home/install) and [join us over on Discord](https://bit.ly/3bbcSl9) to meet the team behind the product as well as other users. In addition, once you have a project set up in Rill Developer, you can then [deploy the project](/deploy/deploy-dashboard) and collaborate with others / invite your team members by [logging into Rill Cloud](https://ui.rilldata.com)!

## User Groups When Sharing
When sharing a dashboard or project, you now have access to user groups in addition to individual users. This makes it even easier to share your project with a larger number of users at once.

## Export Metadata Headers
When scheduling reports, you can now choose to include a metadata header in your file. The header will contain information about the applied filters, time range, and the dashboard being exported. This is useful for tracking the state of the dashboard at the time the report was created. The same feature will soon be available for ad-hoc exports as well!

## Searching in Pivot Pills
You can now search directly within the row and column add dialogs. It was already fast to create a table, now it's even faster!

## Filter Pills for Local Filters in Canvas
When you add a local filter to a widget in a Canvas dashboard, it will now be represented as an inline filter pill inside the widget. This helps end users understand which filters are active for that specific widget.

## Support for AWS STS Authentication in Connectors
We now support AWS STS authentication for our DuckDB and S3 connectors. You can find more details in our [documentation](/connect/data-source/s3#iam-role-based-authentication).

## Cell Inspector for Long Dimension Values
Sometimes, long dimension values are truncated in leaderboards and tables. You can now press the spacebar to toggle the Cell Inspector, which reveals the full value of the cell. This is especially useful when dealing with JSON values or log messages.
