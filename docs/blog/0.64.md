## User Groups when Sharing
When sharing a dashboard or project you now have access to user groups in addition to users making it even easier to share your project with a larger amount of users at once.

## Export metadata headers
When scheduling reports you can now choose to include a metadata header to your file. The header will contain your filters, timerange and what dashboard were being exported. Useful to track what the state of the dashboard were when the report was created. The same feature will soon come to ad-hoc exports as well!

## Searching in Pivot pills
You can now search directly in the row and column add dialog. It was fast to create a table before, now its even faster.

## In Canvas, show Filter pills for local Filters


## Supporting AWS STS authentication for Connectors
We now support AWS STS authentication for our duckdb and S3 connectors. You can find more details in our [documentation](/reference/connectors/s3#iam-role-based-authentication)

## Cell Inspector for Long Dimension Values
Sometimes you are dealing with long dimensional values that gets truncated in our leaderboards and tables.
You now have access to a shortcut, by pressing the spacebar you can toggle the cell inspector on or off and it will show you the full dimensional value. Superuseful when dealing with json values or log messages.
