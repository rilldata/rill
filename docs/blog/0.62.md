# Rill 0.62 - Quick project sharing and controlling your models

:::note
⚡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create fast, exploratory dashboards. Rill Cloud can then help enable shared collaboration at scale.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/home/install) and [join us over on Discord](https://discord.gg/TatjVY32) to meet the team behind the product as well as other users. In addition, once you have a project set up in Rill Developer, you can then [deploy the project](/deploy/deploy-dashboard) and collaborate with others / invite your team members by [logging into Rill Cloud](https://ui.rilldata.com)!

## Easier Project Sharing and User Management

You can now quickly invite new users or add existing ones to a project directly from the Rill Cloud project view.  
Easily assign roles and manage user groups to define access levels within each project. This makes collaboration faster and more intuitive.

## More Control Over Model Refreshes

When working with large data models, having precise control over refresh behavior is crucial.  
We’ve introduced a new property called `change_mode`, which allows you to manually trigger refreshes or selectively apply patches during incremental data loading.

Learn more in our [documentation](https://docs.rilldata.com/build/advanced-models/incremental-models#model-change-modes).
