# Rill 0.9 – Filter pills and even faster profiling

:::note
⚡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create powerful, opinionated dashboards. These are our release notes for our `0.9` release, still in Tech Preview.

[To try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/get-started/install) and [let us know over on Discord](https://discord.gg/TatjVY32) if you encounter any problems or have ideas about how to improve Rill Developer!
:::

One of Rill's core values is *speed* - the kind of speed that makes data work feel like a natural extension of your thoughts and conversation-fast. With this release, we bring continued improvements across the application from *even faster profiles* than our [last release](https://docs.rilldata.com/notes/0.8) to new dimension value filter pills in our dashboard header. We love keeping Rill snappy and you are going to feel the difference at every step of the application.

- **Faster binary install -** Recent updates to our application infrastructure allow us to bundle our Mac and Linux binary in improved ways so you spend less time waiting to see what Rill is all about and more time experiencing it for yourself.  If you have held off trying Rill because `npm install` was taking too long, take this *[fast path](/get-started/quickstart)* and [let us know what you think](https://discord.gg/TatjVY32). We hope to extend this new infrastructure to Windows operating systems in coming releases.

- **Even faster profiling –** Numeric profile queries have been optimized to make the felt experience of profiling even faster. Our histogram query had regressed significantly since January. After rewriting it to be more performant, we are now generating Rill histograms 10x faster!

- **Filter pills –** Our new filter pills dashboard feature captures all of the leaderboard dimension values you have selected for your global filter and makes them more accessible and interactive in the header. No more hunting for that one value you are trying to remove or wondering which combination of filters have been applied. Augmenting your dashboard’s filter set with filter pills will provide a huge improvement in metrics exploration.

- **Improved dialog menus –** Rill’s dialog menus help you ingest new sources and rename assets. This important workflow step has gotten significant [a11y](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility) improvements that make it easier for all people to read the dialog and take action with confidence. We have a lot more work to be done to make Rill more accessible!
