## Comparison in Canvas Charts

Canvas dashboards now support comparison views in charts! You can compare metrics across different time periods directly in your Canvas visualizations, making it easier to spot trends and analyze performance changes over time.

## StarRocks Driver Support

We've added support for StarRocks as a live connector! You can now connect directly to your StarRocks data warehouse and query data in real-time without needing to ingest it into Rill first. This expands our support for enterprise data warehouses alongside our existing connectors for ClickHouse, Druid, Pinot, and more. A big thank you to our community contributor! 

## Geospatial Dimensions

We've added support for geospatial dimensions in metrics views! You can now work with geographic data types and create location-based analytics. This opens up new possibilities for mapping, regional analysis, and spatial data exploration in your dashboards. Look forward to new exciting mapping opportunities in upcoming releases!

## Rill validate

We have added a new cli command, `rill validate`, that allows you validate a project. Very useful in CI/CD flows when you want to run tests on PRs before pushing to production.

## Metrics SQL Enhancements

Metrics SQL now supports cast operators, giving you more flexibility when working with data types in your queries. We've also added dimension type overrides to metrics views, allowing you to customize how dimensions are interpreted and displayed.
