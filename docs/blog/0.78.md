## Default Filters for Canvas

Set up default filters and pin your most important dimensions for quick access! When you're working with large metrics views, it can be a daunting task to sift through all the available dimensions and measures. With default filters, you can build Canvas dashboards that automatically set filters on dimensions by default and pin the ones that matter most—so your users don't have to hunt for them!

## Dynamic Markdown

We're introducing dynamic content in Markdown components! You can now template Metrics SQL queries directly into your Canvas dashboard that automatically react to user filters, creating a fully dynamic markdown experience. Want to take it even further? You can render HTML too! Plus, we're making the backend endpoint public so you can easily build your own programs and workflows that need access to templated data.

## Query Attributes

If you're using ClickHouse, you can now append query attributes that access dynamic user attributes. This is super useful if you want to send along, for example, a user ID or email to route or filter views in ClickHouse based on Rill user context. Or if you want to build your own usage reporting based on queries issued to your ClickHouse instance.
