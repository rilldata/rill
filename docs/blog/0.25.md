Rill helps you go from data to an interactive dashboard in minutes using thoughtful-but-opinionated defaults. One way we quickly get everyone to a meaningful dashboard is by assuming that `VARCHAR` data types make good dimensions for drilldowns by default, however it was also a constraint becasue we _did not_ allow other types to be dimensions.

Our users let us know that it would be useful to have dimensions for more data types because no one wants to `CAST` columns into an arbitrary type to be able to add them to their dashboard. In this release we relax type constratints to help you build a _meaningful_ dashboard faster than ever.

- **All data types can be dashboard dimensions - ** Stop casting your columns to `VARCHAR` before adding them to your dashboard. With this release you will now see all columns as options in your metrics editor dimension dropdown.
