## Edit Exported Data Columns in Reports
In our 0.67 release, we introduced the ability to edit reports and alerts. With this release, we’re taking it a step further — you can now edit the underlying **data columns** included in your report exports.  
No more re-creating reports from scratch just to tweak what’s exported. Adjust your columns effortlessly and save time!

## Simplified Time Pills in Pivot
Working with time in Pivot and Flat tables just got easier!  
We’ve combined all time pills into a **single, unified time pill**, letting you quickly switch between different time grains (like day, week, or month) without removing and re-adding fields.  
Your tables are now faster and smoother to work with — less friction, more productivity.

## Schedule Alerts
Previously, alerts would trigger whenever your data refreshed, but scheduling alerts for specific times (like weekly or monthly reports) was tricky.  
With this release, you can now **schedule alerts to run at specific times**.  
Enjoy the confidence and peace of mind knowing your alerts will trigger exactly when you need them.

## Custom Sort Order in Canvas
You can now define a **custom sort order** for categorical dimensions.  
This is especially useful when you need a specific sequence, such as process stages or days of the week.  
Take control of how your data is ordered and make your visualizations more meaningful.
