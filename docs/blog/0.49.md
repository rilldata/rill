# Rill 0.49 - Time comparison in Pivot, flexible deploy options, custom domains and Linux Arch64 support

:::note
âš¡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create fast, exploratory dashboards. Rill Cloud can then help to enable shared collaboration at scale.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/get-started/install) and [join us over on Discord](https://discord.gg/TatjVY32) to meet the team behind the product as well as other users. In addition, once you have a project set up in Rill Developer, you can then [deploy the project](/deploy/deploy-dashboard) and collaborate with others / invite your team members by [logging into Rill Cloud](https://ui.rilldata.com)!

## Time comparison in Pivot
You can now use comparisons inside of the Pivot table in conjunction with time dimensions.
This allows you to get a very detailed breakdown of for example what happend during a specific hour within your comparison period.

## More flexible deploys
We have made various improvements to the deploy flow that allows you to disconnect connected projects to GitHub and a smoother flow in general to deploy your projects.

## Custom Domains
You can now access Rill Cloud under a custom domain if you wanted to share dashboards with external parties or brand your own internal deployment in a specific way. If you are interested in using a custom domain get in touch with us and we'll help you set it up!

## Linux Arch64 support
You can now run Rill on ARM based Linux machines!


## Bug Fixes and Misc
- Starting in v0.49, configured source refreshes will *only* be applied to Rill Cloud by default. If you would like source refreshes to still apply to Rill Developer (or are hosting Rill Developer), you can add `run_in_dev`: true to your source YAML. More information can be found in [our documentation](https://docs.rilldata.com/build/build/models/source-refresh#running-scheduled-refreshes-in-development).
