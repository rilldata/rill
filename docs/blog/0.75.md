## Charts in AI chat

In project chat in Rill Cloud, AI agents can now return rich visualizations directly in the chat. Ask it to visualize your data, and it will respond with charts right inside the conversation!
This builds on last month’s release of citation URLs and full semantic layer access, making Rill’s AI assistant even more powerful for analysis and collaboration.

## Dark Mode for Rill Developer

Dark Mode is now enabled by default in Rill Developer. We've carefully refined connector icons, chart palettes, and UI elements so everything looks great in both light and dark themes.
You can toggle themes under your user icon in the top-right corner.
Coming soon: Full dark mode support in Rill Cloud!

## Themes
We’ve overhauled our theming system to support Dark Mode and **deep dashboard customization**. Control primary, secondary, and background colors—or define your own palette entirely.
Every color in Rill can now be tuned to match your brand or preference.

## Canvas Bookmarks

Canvas dashboards now include the same powerful bookmarking you know from Explore dashboards. Save specific views of your Canvas visualizations, revisit them instantly, or share insights with your team.
Perfect for tracking evolving metrics or comparing perspectives on your data.

## Custom APIs & Partition Discovery (Snowflake & BigQuery)

Discover partitions in Snowflake and BigQuery without ingesting data into Rill.
You can also now create Custom API endpoints that query Snowflake or BigQuery directly—exposing your tables as HTTP endpoints within minutes.

## New Home in Rill Cloud
Rill Cloud has a new homepage!
You now land directly in AI Chat and Dashboards for faster access to insights and collaboration.
