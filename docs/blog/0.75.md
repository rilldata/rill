# Rill 0.75 - AI Developer Agent and Dark Mode

:::note
⚡ **Rill Developer** lets you transform datasets with SQL and build fast, exploratory dashboards. **Rill Cloud** enables collaboration at scale.

## Introducing AI Developer Agent

We're expanding our AI capabilities with a new developer agent that can help you build Rill projects faster. While our existing analyst agent helps you query and understand your data, the new developer agent can generate models and metrics views based on your data structure and requirements.

This is an MVP feature that demonstrates the power of AI-assisted development in Rill. The developer agent understands your data schema and can scaffold out common patterns for transforming and aggregating data, letting you focus on refinement rather than starting from scratch.

Behind the scenes, we've built a flexible agent framework that supports specialized AI agents for different tasks, structured output schemas for reliable results, and improved tool abstractions. You can now also use the `rill chat` CLI command to interact with these agents directly from your terminal.

## Dark Mode is Here

Your eyes will thank you! Dark mode is now enabled by default across Rill Cloud. We've carefully updated connector icons, chart colors, and UI elements to ensure everything looks great in both light and dark themes. Toggle between modes anytime from the theme selector in the interface.

## Canvas Bookmarks

Canvas dashboards now support the same powerful bookmarking functionality you know from explore dashboards. Save specific views of your Canvas visualizations and quickly jump back to them whenever needed. Perfect for tracking different perspectives on your data or sharing specific insights with your team.

## Expanded OLAP Engine Support

We've significantly expanded our OLAP capabilities with native support for four additional database engines:

- **MySQL** - Query MySQL databases directly for partition discovery and data extraction
- **Postgres** - Full OLAP support for PostgreSQL databases
- **Redshift** - Native Redshift connector for warehouse analytics
- **Athena** - Query data in S3 using AWS Athena

These join our existing BigQuery and Snowflake connectors, giving you flexibility to query data where it lives while maintaining fast dashboard performance by outputting to DuckDB.

## Enhanced GCS Authentication

Google Cloud Storage users now have more authentication options with support for HMAC keys and explicit Google application credentials. We've also redesigned the connector workflow with a clearer two-step flow: first authenticate your connector, then create your source or model.

## Managed DuckDB by Default

New Rill projects now include `managed: true` in the default duckdb.yaml configuration. This ensures your DuckDB instance is properly managed by Rill for optimal performance and resource handling.
