## Charts in AI chat
In the project chat in Rill Cloud, the AI agents can now return rich visualizations directly in the chat—ask it to return visualizations and it will oblige! This is in addition to citation URLs and full access to your semantic layer that we introduced last month.

## Dark Mode for Rill Developer

Your eyes will thank you! Dark mode is now enabled by default for Rill Developer. We've carefully updated connector icons, chart colors, and UI elements to ensure everything looks great in both light and dark themes. You will find the dark mode switcher under your user icon in the top right corner of Rill Developer. Full support for dark mode in Rill Cloud is next up!

## Themes
We've massively revamped our theming implementation to support dark mode, and we've added full support to completely theme your dashboards. Control primary, secondary, or background colors. Customize every color palette in the product to your liking!

## Canvas Bookmarks

Canvas dashboards now support the same powerful bookmarking functionality you know from explore dashboards. Save specific views of your Canvas visualizations and quickly jump back to them whenever needed. Perfect for tracking different perspectives on your data or sharing specific insights with your team.

## Custom APIs and partition discovery on Snowflake and BigQuery

You can now discover partitions in Snowflake and BigQuery without having to ingest data into Rill. Additionally, you can now write Custom API endpoints that query data in Snowflake or BigQuery and serve that up as an HTTP endpoint without ever having to bring the data into Rill. Turn your Snowflake tables into HTTP endpoints within minutes!

## New Home in Rill Cloud
Rill Cloud has gotten a facelift and you now have direct access to AI chat and dashboards as the starting point in Rill Cloud!
