** MotherDuck users can interactively explore their data in Rill** - Easily connect a [MotherDuck](/connect/data-source/duckdb) table to a Rill source with a simple duck SQL query. To get started, click _add source_ and choose MotherDuck in the header. Then enter your SQL query and the name of the table before adding the source. After ingestion, you will be able to enjoy keystroke-by-keystroke query profiling that helps shape data transformations into interactive dashboards.

** YAML editor for measure and dimension configuration - ** The metrics editor UI can be challenging to use for complex combinations of measures and dimensions seen in advanced dashboards. We hope that directly exposing YAML will help you edit these configuration metrics much more quickly and effectively than our UI. We aren't quite sure if we have nailed it. Please let us know how the YAML metrics editor improves your ability to quickly create meaningful dashboards in our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/TatjVY32)!

** Display percent-of-total metrics in dashboards - ** Percent-of-total for metrics can provide valuable context for the interpretation of a measure. Elevating percent-of-total in our dashboard is in line with our opinionated view of BI: _make common analytics tasks more scannable and accessible._

** Complete Exports of filtered raw rows from your local dashboard** -  We now allow you to export all of your data, not just the first 10k rows, in CSV and XLSX formats under the raw _Model Data_ export menu.
