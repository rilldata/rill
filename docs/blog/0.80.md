## AI Developer Agent in Beta

We are proud to introduce the AI Developer Agent into Rill Developer. The AI agent is your developer assistant, helping you model data, create and edit Rill project files, and build Rill projects. Give it a try and let us know your experiences! We are continually evolving the feature, so expect more great things to come!

## Alternate Time Dimension Selection

You can now select an alternative time dimension directly in Explore dashboards! Switch between different timestamps (e.g., `created_at` vs `updated_at`) without modifying your metrics view definition. The time dimension picker is available in the time range dropdown, and all time-dependent queries automatically update to use your selected dimension.

## Dark Mode

We are now introducing dark mode to the entire product! Switch between light and dark mode from your profile, upload a dark mode variant of your logo and use custom themes prepared for dark mode! Oh, if you are embedding Rill you also have the ability to toggle dark mode as part of the Embed API.

With the introduction of dark mode some theme properties have changed, your existing themes are backwards compatible but we do recommend you start using the new property names going forward. You can find those by creating a new theme and the default file will have all the new property names populated for you.
