## Alternate Time Dimension Selection

You can now select an alternative time dimension directly in Explore dashboards! Switch between different timestamps (e.g., `created_at` vs `updated_at`) without modifying your metrics view definition. The time dimension picker is available in the time range dropdown, and all time-dependent queries automatically update to use your selected dimension.

## Sticky Dashboard Filters

Dashboard filters now persist across dashboard navigations within a session! When you apply filters on one dashboard and navigate to another, your filter state carries over. This is controlled at the project level with the `sticky_dashboard_state` setting, making it easier to maintain context as you explore different dashboards.

## Cell Inspector for Canvas Dashboards

The Cell Inspector feature from Explore is now available in Canvas dashboards! You can inspect values in KPI tiles and other canvas components, with hover and keyboard accessibility support for detailed data inspection.

## Improved Object Storage Connectors

We've redesigned the connector setup experience for cloud object storage. GCS, S3, and Azure now share a unified multi-step form that guides you through authentication configuration and resource path selection, making it easier to connect to your data.

## KPI Chart Improvements

Sparkline charts in KPI components have been enhanced with better tooltip behavior and comparison data handling. Comparison periods now show formatted timestamps with "vs." date labels, and tooltips reliably trigger based on cursor position.

## @Mention Support in Developer Chat

The AI developer chat now supports @mentions for models and their columns! Type `@` to quickly reference data assets in your conversations, giving the AI more context about your project.
