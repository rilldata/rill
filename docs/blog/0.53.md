# Rill 0.53 - Holiday break, performance and bug fixes

:::note
âš¡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create fast, exploratory dashboards. Rill Cloud can then help to enable shared collaboration at scale.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/home/install) and [join us over on Discord](https://bit.ly/3bbcSl9) to meet the team behind the product as well as other users. In addition, once you have a project set up in Rill Developer, you can then [deploy the project](/deploy/deploy-dashboard) and collaborate with others / invite your team members by [logging into Rill Cloud](https://ui.rilldata.com)!
:::

## Summary

The Rill team has been taking a well deserved break over the holidays but are now back in full force!  
We have been busy bug fixing, working on stability and improved our performance for ClickHouse specifically.
In addition we have switched storage mode for data ingested into Rill, so in case of a infrastructure crash we can easily recover and spin up new resources to serve your data without having to re-ingest it on different nodes within our cluster.

Stay tuned for our upcoming releases as we have lots of exciting new features in store for you!
