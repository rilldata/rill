## Choose How Your Reports Are Delivered

We've added more flexibility to how you share reports with your team and stakeholders. You can now choose between two delivery modes when creating a report:

**Recipient Mode** is perfect for internal distribution lists and team members who need personalized access. When you send a report in Recipient mode, each person who clicks the link will be prompted to log in, and they'll see the dashboard with their own access permissions applied. This means if someone shouldn't see certain data based on your security policies, they won'tâ€”even though everyone received the same report link. It's a great way to share insights across your organization while maintaining data governance.

**Creator Mode** (the default) is ideal when you're sharing reports with external partners, clients, or anyone who doesn't have a Rill account. Recipients get a link to view the dashboard with your permissions, but locked to the specific filters and time range you set when creating the report. No login required, no hassleâ€”just instant access to the exact view you want them to see. They can also download the data directly from the email, making it easy to work with the insights offline.

## Dynamic Height for Embedded Dashboards

If you've embedded Rill dashboards into your applications, you know the pain of dealing with double scrollbarsâ€”one for your page, one for the iframe. We've solved that with a new dynamic height feature.

Simply append `dynamic_height=true` to your embed URL, and the dashboard will automatically size itself to fit its content and emit resize events whenever the dashboard changes size. This lets you dynamically adjust your iframe height to perfectly match the dashboard, creating a seamless, native-feeling experience in your application. No more awkward scrollbars within scrollbars!
