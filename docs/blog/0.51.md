## Billing and Self Serve
You can now manage your own billing of Rill directly from Rill Cloud. From signing up, switching tiers and checking quotas all without ever having to leave your browser. It just got even easier to get started with Rill!

## Sending reports to external users
With our 0.51 release you can now send reports to external non-users of Rill. If a non-user receives a report it will be locked down and secure so that you rest easy that they only have access to the data that you intended for.

Managing your users just got easier! You can now add and remove users directly from within Rill Cloud without using the CLI.
