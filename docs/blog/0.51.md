# Rill 0.51 - Billing in the Cloud, User Management and sending reports to external users!

:::note
âš¡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create fast, exploratory dashboards. Rill Cloud can then help to enable shared collaboration at scale.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/home/install) and [join us over on Discord](https://discord.gg/TatjVY32) to meet the team behind the product as well as other users. In addition, once you have a project set up in Rill Developer, you can then [deploy the project](/deploy/deploy-dashboard) and collaborate with others / invite your team members by [logging into Rill Cloud](https://ui.rilldata.com)!

## Billing and Self Serve
You can now manage your own billing of Rill directly from Rill Cloud. From signing up, switching tiers and checking quotas all without ever having to leave your browser. It just got even easier to get started with Rill!

## Sending reports to external users
With our 0.51 release you can now send reports to external non-users of Rill. If a non-user receives a report it will be locked down and secure so that you rest easy that they only have access to the data that you intended for.

## Managing Users in Rill Cloud
Managing your users just got easier! You can now add and remove users directly from within Rill Cloud without using the CLI.
