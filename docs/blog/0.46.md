# Rill 0.46 - Comparisons everywhere, more improvements to Rill Developer and external OLAP engines.

:::note
⚡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create fast, exploratory dashboards. Rill Cloud can then help to enable shared collaboration at scale.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/get-started/install) and [join us over on Discord](https://discord.gg/2ubRfjC7Rh) to meet the team behind the product as well as other users. In addition, once you have a project set up in Rill Developer, you can then [deploy the project](/deploy/deploy-dashboard/) and collaborate with others / invite your team members by [logging into Rill Cloud](https://ui.rilldata.com)!

## Comparisons everywhere!
Out of the box comparisons have always been a major part of Rill and now we've added comparisons to Rill's Alerts and Pivot tables. This allows you to specify alert criteria on comparison values, such as, "hey alert me if any of my top 100 customers has a decline in sales greater then 10% compared to last week". We've also introduced comparisons to the pivot table where you now can easily toggle on or off time comparisons and easily track changes in your metrics while exploring within the pivot table. Enjoy!

## Rill Developer
In addition to various fixes and performance improvements we have are now grouping the Tables underneath their corresponding connectors for multi connector projects and bring-your-own-OLAP-engine projects.

## OLAP Engines - Even easier
Now you can connect to your own OLAP engine, such as ClickHouse, Druid or Pinot, without having to restart Rill or passing in connection strings as startup parameters. It's as easy as selecting ClickHouse in the Connect dialog and off you go!

- Added more consistency to how page titles are rendered in Rill Developer.
- Fixed issue where the chart type was not properly being retained in the URL state of the time dimension detail.
- Fixed issue where completely clearing a dashboard YAML would stop showing any successive errors even when adding content back to the dashboard YAML.
- Fixed issues or inconsistent states that could sometimes arise when renaming a resource that is actively being reconciled.
- Removed the wand icon from the generate dashboard button.
- Rill now automatically embeds all necessary DuckDB extensions in its installation binary.

- Fixed issue where Rill Developer could hang in specific scenarios when multiple tabs in the browser are open and Rill is attempting to reconcile.
- Added more consistency by skipping invalidation if no filename is present.
- Rill will now automatically set the session timezone as UTC when using the ClickHouse connector.
- Fixed a bug where the time dimension detail chart could error when using comparisons with a dimension that has excluded values.
- Introduced QOL / UX improvements to the alert tab and dialog form.
- Added backend improvements to remove unnecessary and/or redundant network requests in Rill Developer.
- Fixed issue where comparison visualizations do not always work properly when using ClickHouse-backed dashboards.

- Rill now supports setting individual connection properties in our OLAP connectors (ClickHouse, Druid, Pinot).
- Fixed issue where environment-specific YAML overrides were not getting picked up properly for the `sql:` property.
- Fixed an issue where `isSummable` was returning false for functions like `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT`, which would result in bars not being displayed properly in the leaderboard charts.

- Improved how connector names are handled and rendered in the UI, especially when the connector name does not match the driver type. 
- Added improvements to our query invalidation logic when a connector is changed.
