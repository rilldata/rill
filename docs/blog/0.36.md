:::

We've always dreamed big at Rill. Our vision is to provide the fastest way to create insightful dashboards. 
This release features many small improvements, from more configurable dashboards to more flexible data orchestration. Under the hood, this version of Rill packs a new asynchronous orchestration engine, paving the way for file watching, scheduled source refresh, non-blocking source refresh, and many other upcoming features.

## Hot reloading with multi-editor support

From the start, Rill was built around the idea of keystroke-by-keystroke feedback when modelling data. This release includes a file watcher which adds true hot reloading and supports multiple simultaneous editors. This means you can keep two windows of Rill open at the same time, or use an editor such as VS Code side-by-side with the dashboard you're developing.

## Configure source refresh in YAML

You can now configure source refresh schedules directly from a source's YAML file using cron expressions. After a source refresh completes, all models and dashboards that derive from the source will also be refreshed.

Example usage – the following S3 source will refresh every hour:

```yaml
# sources/foo.yaml
type: s3
uri: s3://bucket/foo/*.parquet
refresh:
  cron: 0 * * * *
```

## Non-blocking source refresh

Source data refresh now runs in the background, enabling you to browse cloud dashboards while the underlying data is being refreshed.

This feature also extends to the local development experience, where source import will no longer block the application. This means you can stay productive while waiting for slow sources to download!

## Free-form ISO duration support `default_time_range`

You can now specify any [ISO 8601 duration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations) as the default time range for a dashboard. For example, you can set it to 5 days with `default_time_range: P5D`, or 2 weeks with `default_time_range: P2W`. This feature gives you full customizability to set your favorite time range as your dashboard default.

## Improved project navigation on cloud

We have revamped the cloud overview page to make it easier to navigate to your projects.

## DuckDB 0.9

Last, but not least, this version upgrades Rill to the new version of DuckDB, v0.9.1. Head over to the [DuckDB blog](https://duckdb.org/2023/09/26/announcing-duckdb-090.html) for more details about all its new features.
