## New Time Syntax

Weâ€™re excited to announce a major release: a brand-new time syntax in the product.  
Until now, time ranges relied on ISO durations, such as `P7D` to represent the previous seven days. While standard, ISO durations introduced ambiguity around complete periods, the handling of latest data, and felt rigid for users defining their own time ranges.  

To address these challenges, we designed an entirely new syntax for expressing time. This syntax is now available across the product and gives you precise control over **time ranges, grains, and reference points**.

### Examples

- Want the last 12 hours from the current time?  
  ```12h as of now/h```

- Need the last 24 hours, broken down by hour, but only for completed hours?  
  ```24h as of watermark/h```

Not sure where to start? The new **time picker** makes it simpleâ€”point and click to build the exact time range you want, without needing to remember the syntax.
