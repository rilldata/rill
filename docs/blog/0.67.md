## Navigate to Explore in Canvas

You can now navigate directly from Canvas widgets to an Explore dashboard for deeper analysis. This is especially useful for KPI-style dashboards, allowing users to seamlessly carry over filters and context from Canvas to Explore.

## Edit Alerts and Reports

It’s now possible to modify the underlying filters for Alerts and Reports. This means you can easily update existing ones without needing to delete and recreate them from scratch.

## Model Tests

You can now write SQL tests that assert the correctness of your model’s data during reconciliation. This ensures your models pass data quality checks and that your dashboards reflect accurate information.

```yaml
# model.yaml
type: model
sql: SELECT * FROM range(5)

tests:
  # Test that all values are in a valid range
  - name: Valid Range
    assert: range >= 0 AND range <= 4

  # Test that all values are in a valid range (SQL)
  - name: Valid Range SQL
    sql: SELECT * FROM model WHERE range < 0 OR range > 4

  # Test that row count is exactly 5
  - name: Exact Row Count
    sql: SELECT 'Wrong row count' as error WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM model) != 5
```
