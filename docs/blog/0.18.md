Happy New Year everyone! This release of Rill Developer is fairly light, given that many of us were out celebrating the holidays after having a productive 2022. We do have a number of small improvements and bug fixes to share in our 0.18 release as we look to what 2023 holds:

- **A new workspace header –** Each release, we’re making one small change toward a much bigger refactor of our application hierarchy. This release will have something much more visible; a new header in the workspace.
- **Tweaking spacing –** Given that we moved to using Inter as our UI typeface, we’re continuing to readjust the design of the application to accommodate the additional space. It feels luxurious and we’re growing into it. :)
- **Numerous bug fixes –** We made [ambitious changes to our application](https://docs.rilldata.com/notes/0.16) in 2022 introducing code-based project files that represent the data to dashboard journey. To accomplish this, we had to touch most of the application and it was inevitable that there would be a few bugs and rough edges. We are continuing to squash these bugs thanks to your feedback. Are you seeing anything off in this release? If you do, come let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/TatjVY32).
