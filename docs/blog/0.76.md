## Custom User Attributes

You can now add custom attributes to users via the CLI, and reuse them in access policies and row filters.  
This is especially helpful when embedding Rill—now you can consolidate access rules for both external and internal users in one place.

## API Access and Documentation

We’ve added comprehensive documentation and guides for accessing the Rill API and integrating with other systems.  
Check out [our guides](/guides/integrating-with-rill) to get started, or explore the full [API reference documentation](/api/admin).
