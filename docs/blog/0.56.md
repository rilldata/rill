# Rill 0.56 - Favicons, API for embedded dashboards, query data from the CLI

:::note
⚡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create fast, exploratory dashboards. Rill Cloud can then help to enable shared collaboration at scale.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/home/install) and [join us over on Discord](https://bit.ly/3bbcSl9) to meet the team behind the product as well as other users. In addition, once you have a project set up in Rill Developer, you can then [deploy the project](/deploy/deploy-dashboard) and collaborate with others / invite your team members by [logging into Rill Cloud](https://ui.rilldata.com)!
:::

## Use your own favicon
Building on the previous release, which allowed you to upload a custom logo, you can now also upload a custom favicon to fully brand Rill as your own internal tool.

## API for embedded dashboards
There is now an API to programmatically interact with your embedded dashboards! You can listen for state changes, set and get state on demand, and unlock a wide range of possibilities—such as controlling the filter state from your own page and providing users with a predefined set of filters or views that can be managed dynamically.

## Query data from the CLI
Admins can now query data inside Rill directly from the CLI. Integrate it into your CI pipelines, write tests, or run ad-hoc queries—the sky's the limit!
