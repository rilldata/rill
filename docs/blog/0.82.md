## AI Feedback

You can now give thumbs up and thumbs down to score your conversations with Rill's AI agent. This helps it learn and provide even better and more crisp answers for you and your colleagues in future chats.

## AI in Canvas

We've enabled the AI Agent for Canvas dashboards, so you can have conversations with the agent while browsing your Canvas dashboards.

## New Project Status Page

We have massively overhauled the status page for projects within Rill Cloud. You can now easily search, filter, and find resources—for example, those that are erroring—as well as get full access to logs without having to use the CLI.

## Scatter Plot in Canvas

The Scatter Plot has arrived for Canvas Dashboards! It's a great visualization for seeing the correlation of a dimension across two measures. It also features zooming in and out, as well as the ability to pan around the scatter plot area.

## Model Exports

We're proud to introduce the ability to export data from Rill on a continuous basis. You can now set up scheduled exports of models to object storage such as S3 and GCS, exporting models from Rill as parquet files for downstream processing.

## Use Gemini as your AI provider

We have added support to use Gemini as your preferred AI provider. Create a Gemini connector, set up your API key and you are good to go!
