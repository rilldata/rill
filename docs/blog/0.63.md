## Rill MCP Server

Plug BI into your favorite AI

“What factors are driving high conversion and low CPS for the Black Friday campaigns?”

Rill’s natural language interface, powered by our MCP server and in-memory metrics layer, allows your team members to get insights through conversational prompts, not just dashboard clicks.

Users want to just bring up their favorite chat client and start asking questions. Rill gives your AI access to up-to-date and accurate data, fast enough to keep up with a conversation. At the same time, we provide the same security guarantees and role-based access of the Rill Cloud interface.

You don't even need to install Rill to get started – try talking to our public data models today!
