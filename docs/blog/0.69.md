## Measure Annotations
Introducing the ability to **annotate** points in time on your measures! Add metadata to your measures, such as events that could explain why a metric is moving in a certain direction. Highlight data gaps, related activities, or national holidays. You can annotate individual points in time, ranges of time, or even specific durations such as weeks or quarters. Your time series charts are now even easier to understand!

## Funnel Charts
We are adding funnel charts as a new chart type to Canvas dashboards. Funnel charts are ideal for visualizing process flows such as sales or marketing pipelines. More enhancements are coming soon, including support for uneven funnels, also known as violin plots, to enable visualizations such as population pyramids.

## Theming in Canvas Dashboards
You can now apply your custom themes directly to your Canvas dashboards, so you no longer need to select colors for individual charts!
