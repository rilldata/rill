** BigQuery connector** - Data warehouses like BigQuery are often used as an analytics-ready source of truth. Though Rill doesn't require a data warehouse to start understanding data, it might make more sense to directly tap into this refined data source when it is available. With this release, we include a new connector that allows you to directly pull down a table through a `SELECT` statement from your BigQuery data warehouse. This is a similar functionality as our new [MotherDuck](/connect/data-source/duckdb) connector and we hope you [find it just as useful](https://twitter.com/nicoritschel/status/1686595084454961152).

Let us know how our new connectors helped you quickly build and deploy dashboards in our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/TatjVY32).

** Timezone selector** - The modern business landscape spans multiple timezones, adding complexity to the interpretation of timeseries metrics. For example, there are 4 timezones in the contiguous United States alone and people working across these timezones might want insights that represent _local_ time. This update of Rill lets you set the default timezone during development with the ability to personalize the timezone selected in your cloud dashboard. This feature will empower you and your team to swiftly grasp insights and take decisive action across the globe, no matter where your partners or clients may be located.

Our application assumes that dates and timestamps lacking timezone information are in UTC. To ensure you get the precise results you're after, you may need to cast your dates into the correct timezone. Try a variation of this `CAST` statement during modeling to set your timezone appropriately.

``` TIMEZONE('America/Chicago', DATE '2023-07-01') AS tranform_timezone```
