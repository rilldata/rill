# Rill 0.48 - New Filter bar, ðŸš€ Deploy from Rill Developer and Pivot from Timeseries

:::note
âš¡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create fast, exploratory dashboards. Rill Cloud can then help to enable shared collaboration at scale.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/home/install) and [join us over on Discord](https://discord.gg/TatjVY32) to meet the team behind the product as well as other users. In addition, once you have a project set up in Rill Developer, you can then [deploy the project](/deploy/deploy-dashboard/) and collaborate with others / invite your team members by [logging into Rill Cloud](https://ui.rilldata.com)!

## New Filter Bar
We have a brand new filter bar! It gives you an updated look but also makes the comparison selector and grain selector easier to find and use.
We hope that you will love it as much as we do!

## Deploy from Rill Developer
It's now even easier to get started with Rill, you can now deploy your projects directly to Rill Cloud from within Rill Developer!
Deploy your local project directly without having to connect to GitHub and later when you are ready for version controlled projects and auto-deploys you can easily connect your project to a GitHub repository.

In addition you can now also invite new team members directly from the Cloud UI without having to use the CLI with more user management enhancements coming in the near future!

## Pivot from Timeseries
With just a click of a button you can now easily go from looking at metrics over time to bring them directly into a pivot table to further explore your metrics in a tabular format!
