# Rill 0.44 - New visualization types, File Explorer, Pinot Connector, new installation scripts

:::note
⚡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create fast, exploratory dashboards. Rill Cloud can then help to enable shared collaboration at scale.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/get-started/install) and [join us over on Discord](https://discord.gg/2ubRfjC7Rh) to meet the team behind the product as well as other users. In addition, once you have a project set up in Rill Developer, you can then [deploy the project](/deploy/deploy-dashboard/) and collaborate with others / invite your team members by [logging into Rill Cloud](https://ui.rilldata.com)!

## File Explorer
As both Rill grows and your project grows we have introduced a new way of navigating your project to support both the product growth and your project growth. This is the first release of many with improvements to Rill Developer so stay tuned for future updates!

As we add more and more resource types into Rill to support new functionality it started to be a problem with having fixed sections for certain types. So instead of having fixed listing of files we are now displaying the full project listing in a more traditional file and folder explorer view.

As your project grows with more sources, models and dashboard we wanted to allow authors to organize their project however they wanted and now you can!
Want to group related sources, models and dashboards by data source or department? Now you can!

### Breaking Change

As part of our new Rill Developer overhaul, we have introduced a new keyword `type` that defines the type of file. Please note that existing projects _will continue to work as is_ but if you wish to move your assets to new, non-native directories, then make sure you have either `type: source` added to your source YAML file or `type: metrics_view` added to your dashboard YAML file. Otherwise, the file explorer will complain about the resource type not being defined. Additionally, this change is **not** backwards compatible with Rill releases prior to v0.44.

## Alternative visualizations
When drilling into a metric you can now visualize and compare the metric as a grouped or stacked bar chart or as an area chart. This gives you more freedom to choose the visualization type that is the perfect fit for your data and use-case.

## Pinot Connector
Apache Pinot has been a data source we wanted to support for quite a while and now we do! Let us know what you think!

## New installation scripts
Our new installation scripts allows you to install Rill without having to utilize sudo privileges.  
The new installation script will allow you to install Rill into a local path with optional addition to your local paths.  

If you previously had Rill installed, please uninstall Rill before trying out the new install script if you want to see the new features (Don't worry, it's not mandatory!)  
To uninstall run: `curl https://rill.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall` 


## Bug Fixes and Misc
- All newly deployed projects on Rill Cloud will now use a single directory for all instance data. (*Note: This change will result in an one-time reset of all existing deployed projects but should otherwise not impact production!*)
- Removed the beta flag from the pivot table feature set.
- Fixed an issue where `VARCHAR` and `INTEGER` columns can no longer be unioned without an explicit cast (as a result of this [breaking DuckDB change](https://duckdb.org/2024/02/13/announcing-duckdb-0100.html#breaking-sql-changes) in DuckDB v0.10 to implicit cast behavior to `VARCHAR`).
- Fixed a bug where adding a single metric to columns in the pivot table does not render a total for the metric.
- Added warning and timeout messages when export limits are exceeded.
- Added safeguards against creating a scheduled report or alert on a dashboard when no timestamp column is present.
- Corrected required fields when adding a new dimension to a dashboard.
- Fixed issue where sources couldn't be edited and saved while being refreshed.
- Fixed bug where scheduled reports that were created could disappear and stop running after a period of time.
- Fixed bug where the back button was not always working correctly when a sub-range is selected but not zoomed in on from the time dimension detail.
- Non-admin users should now be able to remove themselves from organizations and projects on Rill Cloud.
- Improved the sizing of measure columns in pivot tables, including the ability to resize columns.
- Fixed issue where the search bar was not available in leaderboards for Druid-backed dashboards.
- Exports should now respect the user search input and filter results accordingly.
- Included defaults for `available_time_ranges` in our dashboard YAML configuration.
- Fixed bug where `rill-QTD` would not always populate correctly when specified in `available_time_ranges` for a dashboard.
- Improved Druid query performance by removing the limit for Druid exactify toplist queries.
- Fixed issue where the Amazon Redshift icon would not render correctly when adding a source while using Safari.
- Fixed issue where the `email_verified` property was not getting properly passed in the OAuth flow when using SAML authentication.
- Added SAML SSO as an available login option when logging into Rill Cloud.
- Improved the Alert detail page so that the time range being used is now shown as part of the Filters section.
- Fixed bug where returning no data for a measure filter would actually result in a full dashboard being shown instead of an empty dashboard.
- Removed deprecated APIs for legacy reconcile.
- Fixed a regression where the source / model workspace preview table was not showing its loading state while reconciling.
- The `type` property should now automatically be included as part of the YAML config of any new resource created in Rill (e.g. sources, dashboards, etc.)
- Removed sources and models as available resources that can be added in Rill Developer when using either ClickHouse or Druid as the OLAP engine.
- Improved terminology in the UI to indicate that a resource is "building" instead of "ingesting" whenever a resource is reconciling while preserving the latter terminology for sources.
- Fixed bug where having multiple unnest dimensions would result in a blank screen being shown in the preview and cause the dashboard to hang.
- Improved the Table Explorer UX within Rill Developer so that clicking on the table entry will now show / hide the table's schema.
- Addressed certain alignment issues in the UI to add more consistency.
- Fixed bug where occasionally switching to the Last 3 Months time range for ClickHouse-backed dashboards could cause the dashboard to hang.
- Fixed issue where dimension names were not always populating correctly in the pivot table when using "Start Pivot" from the time dimension detail view.
- Fixed issue where opening an example dashboard could result in a blank page being shown.
- Improved the default theme file with better example colors.
- Fixed minor issue where the project title icon was sometimes missing.
- Added more consistency to the error page being shown across Rill Cloud and Rill Developer.
- SQL files will now automatically be considered to be model resource types by default within Rill Developer.
- Improved the default editor style and UX to add more consistency.
- Added syntax highlighting for markdown files.
- Improved hardening of the time dimension detail to properly handle empty results being returned from the user search bar.
- Improved hardening of Rill to better handle edge cases around renaming resources and objects.
- Added support for the `time_range_start` and `time_range_end` functions with our metrics SQL syntax.
- Added support for the `between` operator with our metrics SQL syntax.
- Added support for `ignore_paths` in the project's `rill.yaml` to indicate directory paths that should be ignored within the new file explorer UI.
- Added support for domain whitelisting at the project level (not just organization level).
- Improved the formatting of measure values used within alert emails that are received by the end user.
- Added support for inline component definitions within the dashboard YAML.
- Fixed issue where measures containing a "divide by zero" could produce incorrect results for Druid-backed metrics queries.
