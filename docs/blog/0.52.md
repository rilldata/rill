## Visual Explore Editing
With our 0.51 release we introduced the ability to visually edit metrics and dimensions in the metrics view. Now we are extending the same capabilities also for Explore dashboards. So if you prefer a UX experience over editing yaml files directly then this is for you!

## Human Readable URLs
As you navigate around inside of a Rill dashboard what you see on the screen is always present in the URL so that you can easily share that URL with other users and they will see exactly what you are seeing on the screen. Previously we encoded this URL so that it was very hard to read, change or make updates to but with our 0.52 release the URL will now be fully human readable. This allows you to more easily embed a Rill dashboard into intranets and dynamically change what the user sees on the screen and when you get sent a link from someone it's easier to understand what the actual URL will show on the screen.

## Environment Variables - Manage in Rill Cloud
In Rill Cloud you can now visually manage your environment variables for a project. Add, update or delete them directly from Rill Cloud without having to fire up the Rill CLI. Change a password env variable and all your developers have to do is a rill env pull and they are up-to-date!

## Project Breadcrumbs in Rill Developer
As you are navigating around in Rill Developer you will now find breadcrumbs that shows you the associated resources so that you can quickly navigate between them as you are making changes. An early quality of life holiday present!
