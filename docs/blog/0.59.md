# Rill 0.59 - Re-ordering of timeseries and leaderboards and new dashboard properties!

:::note
âš¡ Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL and create fast, exploratory dashboards. Rill Cloud can then help enable shared collaboration at scale.

To [try out Rill Developer, check out these instructions](/home/install) and [join us over on Discord](https://bit.ly/3bbcSl9) to meet the team behind the product as well as other users. In addition, once you have a project set up in Rill Developer, you can then [deploy the project](/deploy/deploy-dashboard) and collaborate with others / invite your team members by [logging into Rill Cloud](https://ui.rilldata.com)!

_psst, did you spot the feature that will ship in next release?_ ðŸ¤«

## Re-order Timeseries and Leaderboards
Any user can now re-order their timeseries and leaderboards. Put the metric that is most important to you at the top!  
In subsequent releases of Rill, we will also remember your choices so you don't have to re-order them on every visit.

## Toggle off Custom Time Ranges
If you want to enforce a specific time range, you now have the ability to disable custom time range selection by specifying `allow_custom_time_range: false` in your Explore and Canvas YAML files.

## Banner in Canvas
Setting and displaying a `banner` is now supported in Canvas dashboards.

## Use DSN for OLAP Connectors
You can now specify a full DSN string for your OLAP connectors such as ClickHouse and Pinot, making it even easier to connect.

## Snowflake Password Authentication Update
Snowflake is starting to phase out single-factor password authentication. If you are using password authentication for your Snowflake source, we recommend migrating to [private key authentication](/reference/connectors/snowflake#using-keypair-authentication) to avoid service disruptions.
