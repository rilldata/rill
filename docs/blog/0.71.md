## Multiple Metrics and Combo Chart
For your Canvas dashboards, you can now add multiple metrics to bar and line charts to easily compare metrics across dimensions. In addition, we are also adding a new chart type: the Combo chart. It allows you to visualize a bar metric and a line metric in the same visualization with two separate scales.

## Use the Embed API with Canvas
The Embed API now supports Canvas dashboards! You can listen for changes, and set or get dashboard state directly from the embedding page. Stay tunedâ€”more methods are coming soon.

## Start Rill Developer with automatic credential syncing
When you run `rill start`, Rill will now automatically pull the latest credentials from Rill Cloud if youâ€™re authenticated.  
No more starting a project only to realize your local credentials are out of date!

## Configure connections with simpler forms
Many of our connector forms have gotten a faceliftâ€”theyâ€™re now cleaner and easier to configure.

## Navigate Explore dashboards in embeds
When setting `navigation: true` for embeds, Canvas dashboards now include navigation to a linked Explore dashboard for every component.
