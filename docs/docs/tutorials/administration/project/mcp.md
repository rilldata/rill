Under the AI tab in an individual project, we provide an easy MCP client JSON to copy and paste into the Agent of your choice.

Click the 'Create token' button and copy the code text and paste into your config.json.

The user token that is generated in the UI is tied to your login. So if you've enabled [row access policies](/manage/security), this will also apply your Agent chat. 

Here's an example of it working in Claude! For more information, see our documentation, [here](/explore/mcp).
