### Advanced Features of Rill

Deploying to Rill Cloud is only the first step. In this course, we will return back to Rill Developer to utilize some of Rill's advanced features such as Advanced Modeling, Custom APIs, Alerts and more. 

After making these changes, we'll have to push the changes to Rill Cloud to implement. 

import CustomDocCardList from '@site/src/components/CustomDocCardList';

<CustomDocCardList />
