There might be occasions that sharing a dashboard to a 'non-user' is required in your workflow. In order to accomdate such situations, you can send a public URL of your dashboard with set parameters and with a expiration date if required.


### Accessing your Dashboard in Rill Cloud
Once you have deployed your project to Rill Cloud, you should be able to access the project via the following URL:

[Go to Rill Cloud](https://ui.rilldata.com/)

You can select your project from the list and select your dashboard.

<br />

### Adding Filters and Creating the Public URL

When sharing to your end-user, it is likely that you will want to specific a specific amount of filters. Once set, the end-user cannot view or modify the set filters so they will only be allowed to view a set portion of the dasboard that you define. 


Once your dashboard is ready, you can create the public URL via the `Share` button.

### Managing Public URLS in Rill Cloud

**via UI** 

Public URL can also be managed via the Settings page in Rill Cloud. Please refer to the [administrators guide](https://docs.rilldata.com/tutorials/administration/project/project-maintanence#public-url-management)!



**via CLI**

Checking the public URL can be done by running the following:

```bash
rill public-url list --project <your_project>
  ID                                     DASHBOARD     FILTER                                CREATED BY              CREATED ON            LAST USED ON          EXPIRES ON

NOTE: For security reasons, the actual URLs can't be displayed after creation.
```
As you can see, you can receive information on who created, what filters, when it expires, etc.

### Example Public URL

Feel free to take a look at the created public URLs and note the difference between a dashboard with a filter and without.
