For this example, we will use the OpenRTB Programmatic Advertising project available in our [examples repostory.](https://github.com/rilldata/rill-examples/tree/main/rill-openrtb-prog-ads). 


## Dashboard Access Policies

While there are times that you can completely limit a user from viewing a dashboard by setting up [dashboard-level access](https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/security#restrict-dashboard-access-to-users-matching-specific-criteria), there are times that you might want to re-use the same dashboard but limit the view based on the user.

Depending on how you will manage the row policies, depends highly on the type of data and the domain. IE, if the domain of the user matches with a column's value, then you will not need to create any mapping. However, in this example, we will cover creating a mapping file, and mapping domains to different values in the column, "Pub Name".

Let's look at the possible values for Pub Name: [Click Here](https://ui.rilldata.com/demo/rill-openrtb-prog-ads/auction)

Some values include: Disney, Pluto TV, LG USA, ...

## Dashboard Access via Mapping Table
### Creating the Mapping Table
There are many ways to set up the mapping file. Whether it's directly in a model SQL, or reading from a S3 bucket. You have the freedom to decide, in this example, we will make it directly in the models/model.sql file.

```SQL
-- Model SQL
-- Reference documentation: https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/project-files/models

    SELECT * FROM (VALUES 
      ('Disney', 'domain.com'),
      ('Disney', 'rilldata.com'),
      ... -- add your email and pub name here!
    ) AS t(PubName, domain)
```

From this SQL file, we create a table that will map the `rilldata.com` domain to `Disney`. You will need to modify the file to add an email domain that fits your email and add a `Pub Name` from one that exists in the demo dashboard.

### Creating the Row level Dashboard Policy
Now that this is created, you have a few options on which level you want to create the security level policy. Some questions to ask yourself is:
1. Am I using the metrics view on other components other than the dashboard? IE: APIs, canvas dashboards
2. If I am using the metrics view in other locations, how strict do I want the metrics layer to be? 

For most situations, you would define the dashboard policies at the metrics view level. So let's do that. Let's create a new metrics view, `auction_data_model_metrics_row_policies.yaml`, and copy the contents of `auction_data_model_metrics.yaml` into it.

In our new file, we want to define the following security rule:
```yaml
security:
  access: true
  row_filter: "Pub_Name IN (SELECT PubName FROM mapping WHERE domain = '{{ .user.domain }}')"
```

From our created model `mapping`, we are running the following SQL statement.

```SQL
SELECT PubName FROM mapping WHERE domain = '{{ .user.domain }}'
```

Using the login information from our current user account, .user.domain will extract the domain from your email. In my case, rilldata.com is being extracted. Since the row `rilldata.com` matches, it returns the value in column PubName, 'Disney'. 

This translated back into the query, runs:

```SQL
security:
  access: true
  row_filter: "Pub_Name IN `Disney`"
```

Which results in the current view:

### Additional Set Up Possibilities

This is a relatively straight forward example of row policies in Rill. By setting up a mapping file, you can allow specific data to be visible for specific individuals.

Let's say you hired a contractor to assist with several customers. Mapping their domain or even email to the accounts will grant them visibility to only that specific data without having to create a new dashboard, metrics view, etc.

Grant Rill Data to three values in 'Pub Name', but for Roy only LG USA. You would need to modify the SQL statement in the metrics view to also accommodate email.
```SQL
-- Model SQL
-- Reference documentation: https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/project-files/models

    SELECT * FROM (VALUES 
      ('Disney', 'domain.com', ''),
      ('Disney', 'rilldata.com', ''),
      ('LG USA', 'rilldata.com', 'roy.endo@rilldata.com'),
      ('Pluto', 'rilldata.com', '')
    ) AS t(PubName, domain, email)
```
```yaml
  row_filter: "Pub_Name IN (SELECT PubName FROM mapping WHERE domain = '{{ .user.domain }}' {{ if .user.email}} AND email = '{{.user.email}}' {{ end }})"
```

For more possibilities on attributes please see [our documentation](https://docs.rilldata.com/manage/security#user-attributes).


## Dashboard Access (Column-level access)

Another use-case is removing columns for user or groups that do not need them. Going back to our example openrtb project, let's say you are creating this dashboard for bids but do not want to provide specific information to non-company viewers. While you could create a new dashboard and remove some dimensions and measures, you can also use the same dashboard with a specific security policy.

```yaml
security: 
  access: true #access is provided but 
  exclude: #if the use is not part of rilldata, then exclude:
    - if: "'{{ .user.domain }}' != 'rilldata.com'"
      names: 
        - bid_floor_bucket
        - auction_type
        - win_rate
```



In this case, if the user is not part of the Rill Data, they will not be able to view the listed dimension and measures. This is especially the case if your dashboard has customer sensitive information that should not be viewable. 


## Dashboard Access 

This can be set both on the metric view level and at the dashboard level. Simply define an access statement like below:

```yaml
security:
  access: "{{ .user.admin }} OR '{{ .user.domain }}' == 'example.com'"
```
