## In case of the following error:

```bash
connection: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:9000: connect: connection refused
```

This is likely due to using a locally running ClickHouse server. If so, you will not be able to access your locally running server from Rill Cloud. Instead, we suggest using [ClickHouse Cloud](https://clickhouse.com/cloud). 

For steps to setup ClickHouse Cloud, please refer to [our documentation](https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/olap-engines/clickhouse#connecting-to-clickhouse-cloud).
