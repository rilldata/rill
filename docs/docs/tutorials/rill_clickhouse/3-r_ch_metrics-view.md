## Create the Metrics View.

If you noticed in the previous screenshot, we had a table called `uk_price_paid`. This is a dataset that is used in ClickHouse's Learning portal so we thought it was fitting to go ahead and continue on this dataset.

:::note
In the case that you have not already added this table to your local or Cloud database, please follow the step on [ClickHouse's site](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/getting-started/example-datasets/uk-price-paid) for the steps to do so!

### Create metrics view

Let's create a metrics view based on the table via the `Generate metrics via AI`.

### What are we looking at?

This is our metrics view, where we can define measures and dimensions to be used on dashboards.  

```yaml
# Metrics view YAML
# Reference documentation: https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/project-files/explore-dashboards
# This file was generated using AI.

version: 1
type: metrics_view

title: UK Price Paid Metrics
connector: clickhouse
table: uk_price_paid
timeseries: date

dimensions:
    ...

measures:
    ...
```




While we go into more details in our [Rill Basics course](/tutorials/rill_basics/dashboard) and [our documentation](https://docs.rilldata.com/build/dashboards/), let's go over it quickly.

`timeseries` - This is our time column that is used on as our x-axis for graphs.

`connector` - this is our manually defined ClickHouse connector

`dimensions` - These are our categorial columns that we can use on the dashboard to filter and slice;

`measures` - These are our numerical aggregates defined in the metrics layer. We can see functions such as MAX(), COUNT(), and AVG() used on the underlying table.
