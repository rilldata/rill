In your Rill project directory, create a metrics view, `<metrics_view>.yaml`, file in the `metrics` directory. Rill will ingest the metric view definition next time you run `rill start`.

## Properties

### `type`

_[string]_ - Refers to the resource type and must be `metrics_view` _(required)_

_[string]_ - Refers to the table powering the dashboard, should be used instead of model for dashboards create from external OLAP tables (either table or model is required) 

### `timeseries`

_[string]_ - Refers to the timestamp column from your model that will underlie x-axis data in the line charts. If not specified, the line charts will not appear
