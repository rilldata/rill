In your Rill project directory, create a `<theme_name>.yaml` file in any directory containing `type: theme`. Rill will automatically ingest the theme next time you run `rill start` or deploy to Rill Cloud.

To apply that theme to a dashboard, add `default_theme: <name of theme>` to the yaml file for that dashboard. Alternatively, you can add this to the end of the URL in your browser: `?theme=<name of theme>`


## Properties

  - **`primary`** - _[string]_ - Primary color 

  - **`secondary`** - _[string]_ - Secondary color 

## Common Properties
