In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use [MotherDuck](/connect/olap/motherduck) as your OLAP database with Rill to create powerful visualizations from your MotherDuck tables. Since both Rill and MotherDuck are built on DuckDB, they work seamlessly together, providing you with a smooth and efficient analytics experience.



The overall steps of the tutorial are:
1. Launch Rill Developer.
2. Connect to your MotherDuck server via a Rill live connector.
3. Create a metrics view directly on a table in MotherDuck.
4. Create an Explore dashboard via Generative AI.
5. Deploy the dashboard to Rill Cloud, and share with colleagues.

Once completed, you will have a basic understanding of how to use Rill Developer with MotherDuck and can customize the Rill Developer project to create further metrics views based on MotherDuck tables and create more dashboards.
