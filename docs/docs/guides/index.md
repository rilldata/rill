# Welcome to Rill Guides and Tutorials!

### We're thrilled you've joined us on this Th-Rill-ing journey!

These tutorials were built to help you get started with Rill and empower you to build your own projects. The journey from data import, SQL transformations, dashboard creation and finally deployment to Cloud. From there, looking at Rill Cloud specific features, pushing local changes to Rill Cloud, then finally developing custom features.


### Why Rill?
Here at Rill, we believe in business-speed visual analytics. Gone are the days of waiting for your dashboard to load! By utilizing OLAP engines, we strive for quick, reactive dashboards that you can drill down further to make decisions real-time. Not only that, you'll also be able to make traditional dashboards that we call, Canvas Dashboards
