### What is a model?
A model in Rill is used to perform intermediate processing as well as any last-mile ETL on the source data. This includes joining lookup tables to your table to enrich and transform the data for analysis. We recommend creating <a href="https://docs.rilldata.com/build/models/#one-big-table-and-dashboarding" target="_blank">"One Big Table"</a> to power your metrics views. 

### Create a Model from the Source

Go ahead and select the `Create Model` button in the top right-hand corner of the commits dataset.

<img src = '/img/tutorials/rill-basics/Add-Model.gif' class='rounded-gif' />
<br />

You'll be automatically redirected to the model page. On the left panel, you'll see a models folder created with the file `commits__model.sql`. On the right panel, you'll find general information about your model table, the column values, and at the bottom of the page, a preview of the data.

```SQL
select * from commits
```

Let's try to make some changes to our SQL and see how the UI reacts.

```SQL
select * from commits order by author_date DESC
```
Notice that the preview table is automatically updated as we modify the SQL. This is due to our auto-save feature. In case any errors are encountered, the UI will update accordingly and display the error.

:::tip
 
 Our Autosave feature can be enabled or disabled as needed via the rill.yaml file / project settings, or by simply selecting the toggle in the UI.

### Let's merge two tables!

Each dataset independently gives us some interesting information, but we want to view the data from both of these datasets in a single dashboard.
- `commits` gives us information about the user who committed the changes.
- `modified_files` gives us information on the actual changes to the file and its directory.

We will grab all the columns from `commits` and only a few from `modified_files` as seen below. We will join the two datasets on the `commit_hash` column. As this is the SQL view that our dashboard will be based on, we want to materialize it!

```SQL
-- Model SQL
-- Reference documentation: https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/project-files/models
-- @materialize: true

SELECT
    a.*,
    b.filename,
    b.added_lines,
    b.deleted_lines
FROM
    commits a
INNER JOIN
    modified_files b
ON
    a.commit_hash = b.commit_hash
```

:::tip 
You can see all referenced source tables in the right panel, as well as the column schema and an overview of the data. Select a model to be redirected to the model.

### Concept: What is materialization?

By default, models created in DuckDB will be views. Both views and tables will be shown in under your DuckDB's connector table UI.

```yaml
-- @materialize: true
```
<details>
  <summary>Why materialize?</summary>
  
   You may experience some improved performance materializing SQL views for intermediate models in the case of complex SQL or large data. We generally recommend materializing finals models that power dashboards.  However, you might experience some degradation of modeling experience [auto-save feature] for some specific situations including cross joins.
