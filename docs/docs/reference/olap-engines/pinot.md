## Overview

[Apache Pinot](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/) is a real-time distributed OLAP datastore purpose-built for low-latency, high-throughput analytics, and perfect for user-facing analytical workloads.

Rill supports connecting to an existing Pinot cluster and using it as an OLAP engine to power Rill dashboards built against [external tables](../../concepts/OLAP#external-olap-tables).

## Configuring Rill Developer with Pinot

When using Rill for local development, there are a few options to configure Rill to enable Pinot as an OLAP engine:
1. Connect to an OLAP engine via Add Data. This will automatically create the `druid.yaml` file in your `connectors` folder and populate the `.env` file with `connector.druid.password` or `connector.druid.dsn` depending on which you select in the UI.

<br />

2. You can set `connector.pinot.dsn` in your project's `.env` file or try pulling existing credentials locally using `rill env pull` if the project has already been deployed to Rill Cloud
3. You can pass in `connector.pinot.dsn` as a variable to `rill start` directly (e.g. `rill start --env connector.pinot.dsn=...`)

:::tip Getting DSN errors in dashboards after setting `.env`?

If you are facing issues related to DSN connection errors in your dashboards even after setting the connection string via the project's `.env` file, try restarting Rill using the `rill start --reset` command.

:::

## Connection string (DSN)

Rill connects to Pinot using the [Pinot Golang Client](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/users/clients/golang) and requires a connection string of the following format: `http://<user>:<password>@<broker_host>:<port>?controller=<controller_host>:<port>`. If `user` or `password` contain special characters they should be URL encoded (i.e. `p@ssword` -> `p%40ssword`). This should be set in the `connector.pinot.dsn` property in Rill.

<img src = '/img/reference/olap-engines/pinot/pinot-dsn.png' class='rounded-gif' />
<br />

As an example, this typically looks something like:

```bash
connector.pinot.dsn="http(s)://username:password@localhost:8000?controller=localhost:9000"
```

:::info Need help connecting to Pinot?

If you would like to connect Rill to an existing Pinot instance, please don't hesitate to [contact us](../../contact.md). We'd love to help!

:::

## Setting the default OLAP connection

You'll also need to update the `olap_connector` property in your project's `rill.yaml` to change the default OLAP engine to Pinot:

```yaml

olap_connector: pinot

```

:::note

For more information about available properties in `rill.yaml`, see our [project YAML](../project-files/rill-yaml.md) documentation.

Please see our [Using Multiple OLAP Engines](multiple-olap.md) page.

## Configuring Rill Cloud

When deploying a Pinot-backed project to Rill Cloud, you have the following options to pass the appropriate connection string to Rill Cloud:
1.  If you have followed the UI to create your Pinot connector, the password or dsn should already exist in the .env file. During the deployment process, this `.env` file is automatically pushed with the deployment.
2. Use the `rill env configure` command to set `connector.pinot.dsn` after deploying the project
3. If `connector.pinot.dsn` has already been set in your project `.env`, you can push and update these variables directly in your cloud deployment by using the `rill env push` command

:::info

Note that you must `cd` into the Git repository that your project was deployed from before running `rill env configure`.

:::

## Support for Multi-Valued dimensions

Multi-Valued dimensions needed to be defined in the dashboard yaml as expressions using `arrayToMv` function. For example if `RandomAirports` is a multi-valued column in a Pinot table then the dimension definition will look like:

```yaml
- label: RandomAirports
  expression: arrayToMv(RandomAirports)
  name: RandomAirports
  description: "Random Airports"
```
Refer to the [Dashboard YAML](../project-files/explore-dashboards) reference page for all dimension properties detail. 

:::note

Pinot does not support unnest function so don't set `unnest` property to true in the dimension definition of dashboard yaml.

:::

## Additional Notes

- At the moment, we do not support modeling with Pinot. If this is something you're interested in, please [contact us](../../contact.md).
- For dashboards powered by Pinot, [measure definitions](../../build/metrics-view/metrics-view.md#measures) are required to follow [Pinot SQL](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/users/user-guide-query/querying-pinot) syntax.
