The `rill.yaml` file contains metadata about your project.

## Properties

**`title`** — the name of your project which will be displayed in the upper left hand corner [deprecated, use `display_name`] _(required)_.

**`display_name`** - Refers to the display name for the metrics view _(required)_.

**`compiler`** — the Rill project compiler version compatible with your project files (currently defaults to: `rillv1`)

**`olap_connector`** - the default OLAP engine to use in your project

**`mock_users`** — a list of mock users to test against dashboard [security policies](/manage/security). For each mock user, possible attributes include:

  - **`email`** — the mock user's email _(required)_
  - **`name`** — the mock user's name
  - **`admin`** — whether or not the mock user is an admin

## Configuring the default OLAP Engine

Rill allows you to specify the default OLAP engine to use in your project via `rill.yaml`. This setting is configurable using the `olap_connector` property (and will otherwise revert to `duckdb` if not specified). 

```yaml
olap_connector: clickhouse
```

## Project-wide defaults

In `rill.yaml`, project-wide defaults can be specified for a resource type within a project. Unless otherwise specified, _individual resources will inherit any defaults_ that have been specified in `rill.yaml`. For available properties that can be configured, please refer to the YAML specification for each individual resource type - [sources](sources.md), [models](models.md), and [dashboards](explore-dashboards.md)

:::note Use plurals when specifying project-wide defaults

In your `rill.yaml`, the top level property for the resource type needs to be **plural**, such as `sources`, `models`, and `dashboards`.

:::

For example, the following YAML configuration below will set a project-wide default for:
- **Sources** - Configure a [source refresh](/build/connect/source-refresh.md).
- **Models** - Automatically materialize the models as tables instead of views (the default behavior if unspecified).
- **Metrics View** - Set the [first day of the week](metrics-view.md) for timeseries aggregations to be Sunday along with setting the smallest_time_grain.
- **Explore Dashboards** - Set the [default](explore-dashboards.md) values when a user opens a dashboard, and available time zones and/or time ranges.

```yaml
title: My Rill Project

sources:
  refresh:
    cron: '0 * * * *'
    # Uncomment to run cron jobs in development:
    # run_in_dev: true

models:
  materialize: true

metrics_views:
  first_day_of_week: 1
  smallest_time_grain: month

    time_range: P24M
  
  time_zones:

    - Asia/Jerusalem
    - Europe/Moscow
    - Asia/Kolkata
    - Asia/Shanghai
    - Asia/Tokyo

:::info Hierarchy of inheritance and property overrides

As a general rule of thumb, properties that have been specified at a more _granular_ level will supercede or override higher level properties that have been inherited. Therefore, in order of inheritance, Rill will prioritize properties in the following order:
1. Individual [source](/reference/project-files/sources.md)/[model](/reference/project-files/models.md)/[dashboard](/reference/project-files/explore-dashboards.md) object level properties (e.g. `source.yaml` or `dashboard.yaml`)
2. [Environment](/docs/build/models/environments.md) level properties (e.g. a specific property that have been set for `dev`)
3. [Project-wide defaults](/reference/project-files/rill-yaml.md#project-wide-defaults) for a specific property and resource type

## Setting variables

Primarily useful for [templating](/deploy/templating.md), variables can be set in the `rill.yaml` file directly. This allows variables to be set for your projects deployed to Rill Cloud while still being able to use different variable values locally if you prefer. 

To define a variable in `rill.yaml`, pass in the appropriate key-value pair for the variable under the `env` key:
```yaml
env:
  numeric_var: 10
  string_var: "string_value"
```

:::info Overriding variables locally

Variables also follow an order of precedence and can be overriden locally. By default, any variables defined will be inherited from `rill.yaml`. However, if you manually pass in a variable when starting Rill Developer locally via the CLI, this value will be used instead for the current instance of your running project:

```bash
rill start --env numeric_var=100 --env string_var="different_value"
```

:::

:::tip Setting variables through `.env`

Variables can also be set through your project's `<RILL_PROJECT_HOME>/.env` file (or using the `rill env set` CLI command), such as:
```bash
variable=xyz
```

Similar to how [connector credentials can be pushed / pulled](/build/credentials/credentials.md#pulling-credentials-and-variables-from-a-deployed-project-on-rill-cloud) from local to cloud or vice versa, project variables set locally in Rill Developer can be pushed to Rill Cloud and/or pulled back to your local instance from your deployed project by using the `rill env push` and `rill env pull` commands respectively.

:::

## Ignoring files and directories within Rill

There are times where you may have extraneous directories or files within your Rill project that you would like to be ignored by Rill (potentially also leading to parsing errors). The `ignore_paths` property can be specified in your `rill.yaml` file for this purpose by specifying a list of directories and/or files to ignore.

```yaml
ignore_paths:
  - /path/to/ignore
  - /file_to_ignore.yaml
```

:::tip

Don't forget the leading `/` when specifying the path for `ignore_paths` and this path is also assuming the relative path from your project root.

:::

## Testing access policies 

During development, it is always a good idea to check if your [access policies](/manage/security.md) are behaving the way you designed them to before pushing these changes into production. You can set mock users which enables a drop down in the dashboard preview to view as a specific user. 

```yaml
mock_users:
- email: john@yourcompany.com
  name: John Doe
  admin: true
- email: jane@partnercompany.com
  groups:
    - partners
- email: anon@unknown.com
```


![View as User](/img/reference/project-files/View-as.png)


:::info The View as selector is not visible in my dashboard, why?

This feature is _only_ enabled when you have set a security policy on the dashboard. By default, the dashboard and it's contents is viewable by every user.
