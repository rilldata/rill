# AI Configuration

Rill's AI capabilities, including [AI Chat](/explore/ai-chat) and the [MCP Server](/explore/mcp), rely on context to provide accurate and relevant answers. You can provide this context using the `ai_instructions` field in your project configuration files.

LLMs give their best results when they have good context. For a conversation with Rill Data, this means things like clarifying project-specific terms, routing questions to the correct metrics view, or defining business rules. Rather than expecting the user to provide this context every time, you can add `ai_instructions` to your project. This adds the context automatically for every conversation.

There are two places to add `ai_instructions`:

1.  **`rill.yaml`**: Project-wide instructions that apply to all queries across your entire project.
2.  **`<metrics_view>.yaml`**: Metrics view-specific instructions for individual dashboards.

## Project-Level Instructions ([`rill.yaml`](/build/project-configuration))

Use the `ai_instructions` field in `rill.yaml` to provide information that is **unique to your project**. This helps the AI agent deliver more relevant and actionable insights tailored to your specific needs.

**What to include:**
- Guidance on which metrics views are most important or should be prioritized for your project
- Any custom business logic, definitions, or terminology unique to your data or organization
- Preferences for aggregations, filters, or dimensions that are especially relevant to your use case
- Specific business context that helps the AI understand your domain

**Example:**

Here's an example of how you might configure `ai_instructions` in your `rill.yaml` to provide project context, metrics routing, and business definitions:

```yaml
ai_instructions: |
  # Project Context
  This project tracks e-commerce metrics for our multi-brand retail business.
  
  # Metrics View Routing
  - For questions about overall sales, revenue, or order volume → use `company_sales_metrics`
  - For questions about customer behavior, retention, or cohorts → use `customer_analytics`
  - For questions about product performance or inventory → use `product_metrics`
  - For questions about marketing campaigns or attribution → use `marketing_performance`
  - For questions about fulfillment, shipping, or logistics → use `operations_metrics`
  
  # Business Rules & Definitions
  - "Revenue" always refers to net revenue (after returns and discounts)
  - "Conversion rate" is calculated as orders/sessions, not users
  - Our fiscal year starts in February, not January
  - "Active customer" means a purchase within the last 90 days
  - Weekend traffic patterns are anomalous due to our B2B focus
  
  # Company Acronyms
  - GMV = Gross Merchandise Value
  - AOV = Average Order Value
  - ROAS = Return on Ad Spend
  - SKU = Stock Keeping Unit
  - NDR = Net Dollar Retention
  - CLTV = Customer Lifetime Value
  
  # Known Data Quirks
  - Mobile web data before March 2024 is incomplete due to tracking migration
  - European region data excludes VAT (use `revenue_with_vat` dimension if needed)
  - Refunds are processed with a 2-3 day delay, so recent data may shift
```

## Metrics View-Level Instructions ([`<metrics_view>.yaml`](/build/metrics-view/what-are-metrics-views))

You can provide context and instructions for AI tools interacting with a specific metrics view using the `ai_instructions` field in the metrics view's YAML file. This is useful for clarifying specific metrics, dimensions, or data quirks that apply only to that specific view.

**Example:**

```yaml
ai_instructions: |
  # Measure Definitions
  - "Churn Rate" excludes trial users who cancelled within 7 days.
  - "Active Users" are defined as users with at least one login in the selected period.

  # Data Context
  - Data for the "Legacy Plan" is static and will not update after Dec 2023.
  - When analyzing "Revenue", always breakdown by "Region" to see currency impacts.
```
