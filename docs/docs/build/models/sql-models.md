## Adding a data model

Add a new data model by either clicking 'model' in the 'Add' menu or selecting the '...' in any connector view or existing model. When you add a model, a code definition will automatically be created as a `<model_name>.sql` file in the `models` folder of your Rill project.

You can also create a model outside of the application and add it to Rill by placing a `<model_name>.sql` file in the `models` directory containing a DuckDB SQL `SELECT` statement. Rill will automatically detect and parse the model the next time you run `rill start`.

## Annotating your models with properties

In most cases, objects are represented in Rill as YAML files. Models are unique in that any `<model>.sql` file can be considered a model resource in Rill, representing a SQL transformation that you would like to perform using a set of inputs and outputting a view or table (depending on the materialization type). For most other resources, available properties can be set directly via the corresponding YAML file. In the case of a model SQL file though, configurable properties should be set by annotating the top of the file using the following syntax:

```sql
-- @property: value
select * from users
```

We will cover different available configurable properties in the sections below.

### Marking your model SQL file as a model resource type

By default, any new model that is created in a Rill project will populate a corresponding `.sql` file representing the model. Similarly, a `.sql` file that is directly created in the project directory will also be _automatically assumed_ by Rill to be a model by default. Therefore, it is not necessary to annotate the model resource with the `type` property.

For consistency or documentation purposes, if you'd like to annotate your model resource as well with the `type` property, you can do so by adding the following to the top of your `<model_name>.sql`:
```sql
-- @type: model
select * from orders
```

### Specifying the Data Source Connector

The `@connector` annotation explicitly defines which data source connector to use when executing the SQL query. This parameter is essential when working with multiple connectors of the same type, as it determines which connection credentials and source path to utilize. By default, query results are written to the project's default [OLAP engine](/connect/olap#olap-engines).

```sql
-- @connector: bigquery
SELECT * FROM project_id.dataset_name.table_name
```

```sql
-- @connector: postgres
SELECT * FROM mydb.public.users
```

For projects configured with [multiple OLAP engines](/connect/olap/multiple-olap), you can specify both input and output connectors for a SQL model. Nested parameter syntax uses dot notation (e.g., `output.connector`).

```sql
-- @connector: clickhouse
-- @output.connector: clickhouse
select from clickhouse_table
```

## Working with Pivots

Pivots deserve their own section, as using the [Pivot](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/pivot) statement while modeling requires special consideration. Notably, there are a few existing DuckDB limitations to consider:
- DuckDB's [SQL to JSON serializer](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/json.html#serializing-and-deserializing-sql-to-json-and-vice-versa) doesn't support `PIVOT` without the `IN` [filter](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/pivot#in-filter-for-on-clause)
- DuckDB doesn't support creating views based on `PIVOT` without an `IN` filter (and all models are materialized as views by default in Rill)

Fortunately, there are workarounds available to address these limitations.

#### Passing the `IN` Filter with Your `PIVOT` Statement

If you know the exact values you want to pivot on, you can specify them using an `IN` filter with your `ON` clause. For example, instead of:

```sql
PIVOT table_name ON column_name USING SUM(measure)
```

You can use the following `PIVOT` statement:

```sql
PIVOT table_name ON column_name IN (value_a, value_b, value_c) USING SUM(measure)
```
