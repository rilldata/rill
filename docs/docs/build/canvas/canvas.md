For a more classic dashboard creation experience, Canvas dashboards can create a first look into your data at a top level. Similar to how Explore dashboards are built on top of a metrics view, Canvas does the same but also allows you to connect to various metrics view to display in a single view. 

:::tip
In order to enable this feature, which is in public beta, you will need to add the following to your `rill.yaml` file.

```
features:
   - canvasDashboards
```

:::

- **metrics view**: powers the different components within a single Canvas Dashboard
- **measures**: defined in your metrics view, you can select the measure to display 
- **dimensions**: defined in your metrics view, you can select the dimensions to display 
- **components**: a single object within a Canvas dashboard, including KPIs, charts, tables, and more!

## Making small changes to the YAML 
As always, while we allow our users to create and modify the dashboard via the UI, you can always change the view to a more traditional YAML text by selecting the toggle.
