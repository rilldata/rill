The Rill project file `rill.yaml` is often overlooked but is a powerful tool, as it sets defaults, environment variables, and connector settings. Let's walk through setting up [`mock_users`](/build/metrics-view/security#testing-policies-in-rill-developer) to test row access policies, default security settings for your metrics views and explore dashboards, refresh schedules, MCP `ai_instructions`, and the default OLAP connector.

For a list of all supported settings, see our [project YAML reference page](/reference/project-files/rill-yaml).


## Model Defaults

### Project Refresh Schedule
Set up your project's model refresh schedule. You can override this in the model's YAML file if needed.
```yaml
models:
    refresh:
        cron: '0 * * * *'
```

### Default dev and prod environments

Rill comes with default `dev` and `prod` properties defined, corresponding to Rill Developer and Rill Cloud, respectively. You can use these keys to set environment-specific YAML overrides or SQL logic.

For example, the following `rill.yaml` file explicitly sets the default materialization setting for models to `false` in development and `true` in production:
```yaml
dev:
  models:
    materialize: false

prod:
  models:
    materialize: true
```

### Specifying a custom environment

When using Rill Developer, instead of defaulting to `dev`, you can run your project in production mode using the following command:

```bash
rill start --environment prod
```

## Specifying environment specific YAML overrides

If you wanted to set a project-wide default in `rill.yaml` where models are [materialized](/build/models/performance#materialization) only on Rill Cloud (i.e., `prod`) and dashboards use a different default [theme](/build/dashboards/customize.md#changing-themes--colors) in production compared to locally, you could do this by:

```yaml
prod:
  models:
    materialize: true
  explores:
    theme: <name_of_theme>
```

## Default OLAP Connector
When adding an OLAP connector to your project, this will automatically populate with the new OLAP connector. e.g., `ClickHouse`, `Druid`

## `ai_instructions`
Use the `ai_instructions` field to provide information that is **unique to your project**. This helps the agent deliver more relevant and actionable insights tailored to your specific needs.

**What to include:**
- Guidance on which metrics views are most important or should be prioritized for your project.
- Any custom business logic, definitions, or terminology unique to your data or organization.
- Preferences for aggregations, filters, or dimensions that are especially relevant to your use case.

**Example:**
```yaml
ai_instructions: |
  Focus on the `ad_performance` and `revenue_overview` metrics views, as these are most critical for our business users.
  When possible, highlight trends by region and product category.
  Use our internal terminology: "campaign" refers to a single ad initiative, and "placement" refers to a specific ad slot.
```

:::note 
For metric-level specific instructions, `ai_instructions` can also be applied there.

## Mock Users 
Access to your environment is a crucial step in creating your project in Rill Developer. By doing so, you can confidently push your dashboard changes to Rill Cloud. This is done via the `mock_users` in the project file. You can create pseudo-users with specific domains, or admin and non-admin users or user groups, to ensure that access is correct. 

Let's assume that the following are applied to the metrics view.

```yaml
security:
    access: "{{ .user.admin }} OR '{{ .user.domain }}' == 'example.com'"
    row_filter: "domain = '{{ .user.domain }}'"
```

In order to test both access to the dashboard, as well as the row filter, you can create the following in the project YAML.

```yaml
mock_users:
  - email: royendo@rilldata.com
    admin: true
  - email: your_email@domain.com
    groups:
      - tutorial-admin
  - email: your_email2@another_domain.com
```

### Embedded Dashboard Mock Users
Embedded dashboards are another type of dashboard that you'll want to test in Rill Developer, mainly because there is no way to pass custom variables in Rill Cloud to ensure that access and data are being presented correctly. To do this, you'll need to add the following to your `mock_users`:
```yaml
- email: embed@rilldata.com
  name: embed
  custom_variable_1: Value_1 #this is passed at embed creation
  custom_variable_2: Value_2 #this is passed at embed creation
```
See our [Custom Attributes Embedded Dashboard](https://rill-embedding-example.netlify.app/rowaccesspolicy/custom) live!

Let's assume a similar setup to the above example. Within the metrics view, we define:

```yaml
security:
  access: true
  row_filter: >
    app_site_name = '{{ .user.app_site_name }}' AND
      pub_name = '{{ .user.pub_name }}'
```

Then within the application we are passing

```yaml
app_site_name='Sling'
pub_name='MobilityWare'
```

You can create a test mock user to ensure that this dashboard is working as designed with the following:

```yaml
- email: embed@rilldata.com
  name: embed
  app_site_name: 'Sling' 
  pub_name: 'MobilityWare'
```
<img src = '/img/tutorials/admin/custom-attribute-mock-user.png' class='rounded-gif' />
<br />



## Metrics Views Defaults
By default, Rill is open to access (to your organization users), unless otherwise defined. To add project-level access to the Rill project, you can add a default metrics view security policy in the `rill.yaml` file. Like a metrics_view, you can define the security as shown below. For more information, read our [data access documentation](/build/metrics-view/security#examples).

```yaml
metrics_views:
  security:
    access: {boolean expression}
    row_filter: {SQL expression}
```

Other parameters that can be set in the defaults are `first_day_of_week` and `smallest_time_grain`.

## Explore Defaults
Similar to metrics views, you can set [security for an explore dashboard](/build/dashboards/#define-dashboard-access). (Note that only `access` can be set at the dashboard level.)

```yaml
explores:
  security:
    access: {boolean expression}
```

You are also able to set the `defaults` parameter in the explore dashboard to define your default time range, as well as the available time_zones and time_ranges in an Explore dashboard.
```yaml
explores:
    defaults:
        time_range: P3M
    time_zones:
        - America/Denver
        - UTC
    time_ranges:
        - PT24H
        - P7D
        - P14D
        - P3M
```
