Metrics Views are a key part of defining your measures and dimensions. 

### Metrics 101
- [**What are Metrics Views?**](/build/metrics-view/what-are-metrics-views) - Define your time series, measures, and dimensions using your OLAP engine aggregate functions
- [**Time Series**](/build/metrics-view/time-series) - What is a time series column and how to use it in your metrics view

### Dimensions
- [**Dimension URI**](/build/metrics-view/dimensions/dimension-uri) - Generate unique identifiers for your dimension values
- [**Unnesting Arrays**](/build/metrics-view/dimensions/unnesting) - Work with array data by expanding nested structures
- [**Lookup Dimensions**](/build/metrics-view/dimensions/lookup) - Create dimensions that reference data from other sources

### Measures

- [**Case Statements and Filters**](/build/metrics-view/measures/case-statements) - Use conditional logic and filtering in your measures
- [**Referencing Measures**](/build/metrics-view/measures/referencing) - Reference and combine existing measures in your calculations
- [**Quantiles**](/build/metrics-view/measures/quantiles) - Calculate percentiles and quantiles for statistical analysis
- [**Fixed Measures**](/build/metrics-view/measures/fixed-measures) - Create measures with fixed values and constants
- [**Window Functions**](/build/metrics-view/measures/windows) - Apply window functions for advanced analytical operations

### Security
