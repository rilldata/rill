Query-time joins or more simply, lookup dimensions, provide a powerful way to incorporate reference tables into your dashboard without requiring upstream SQL transformations. This feature enables data enrichment with reference information at query time, eliminating the need for complex ETL processes.

:::note

The lookup function is dependent on the type of [OLAP engine](/connect/olap) that you are using for your project.

## ClickHouse Lookups

ClickHouse provides powerful dictionary functions for lookup operations through a several different dictGet functions. Note that the table needs to be defined as a dictionary. 

```yaml
dimensions:
  - name: user_email
    display_name: "User Email"
    # Query-time lookup in the 'users' dictionary
    expression: dictGet('users', 'email', user_id)
    description: "User email from users dictionary"
    
  - name: product_category
    display_name: "Product Category" 
    expression: dictGet('products', 'category', product_id)
    description: "Product category information"
    
  # With default fallback
  - name: user_email_safe
    display_name: "User Email (Safe)"
    expression: dictGetOrDefault('users', 'email', user_id, 'unknown@example.com')
    description: "User email with fallback for missing users"
    
  # Multiple attributes from same dictionary
  - name: user_full_name
    display_name: "User Full Name"
    expression: concat(dictGet('users', 'first_name', user_id), ' ', dictGet('users', 'last_name', user_id))
    description: "Concatenated full name from user dictionary"
```

## Druid Lookups

For those looking to add ID to name mappings with Druid (as an OLAP engine), you can utilize expressions in your **Dimension** settings. Simply use the lookup function and provide the name of the lookup and ID, i.e. `lookup(city_id, 'cities')`. Be sure to include the lookup table name in single quotes.

```yaml
dimensions:
  - name: city_name
    display_name: "Cities"
    expression: lookup(city_id, 'cities')
    description: "City names from lookup table"
```

## DuckDB/MotherDuck Lookups

Unfortunately, DuckDB does not have a dimension lookup **function** and instead relies on upstream modeling to join the lookup table and create a [one big table](/build/models/models-101#one-big-table-and-dashboarding) for dashboarding. Take a look through [DuckDB docs](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/sql/introduction) for further information!

```sql
SELECT 
    o.*,
    u.user_name
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.email = o.email;
```


Alternatively, you can use DuckDB's `map` function to create a lookup table by mapping values from one column to another. This approach creates an in-memory mapping that can be referenced without using a joining SQL:

```yaml
 - expression: (SELECT map(list(email), list(user_name)) FROM users_dataset)[email]
    name: user_name
```


## Performance Implications

While joins can kill the performance of [OLAP engines](/connect/olap), lookups (key-value pairs) are common to reduce data size and improve query speeds. Lookups can be done during ingestion time (a static lookup to enrich the source data) or at query time (dynamic lookups).

**Static Lookups** 

Static lookups are lookups that are ingested at processing time. When a record is being processed, if a match is found between the record and lookup's key, the lookup's corresponding value at that moment in time is extracted and carbon-copied into your OLAP engine for the records it processed.

Static lookups are best suited for:

- Dimensions with values that require a historical record for how they have changed over time
- Values that are never expected to change (leverage Dynamic Lookups if the values are expected to change)
- Extremely large lookups (hundreds of thousands of records or >50MB lookup file) to improve query performance

Customers typically store lookup values in S3 or GCS, and the lookup file is then updated by customers as needed and consumed by ETL logic.

**Dynamic Lookups**

Since static lookups transform and store the data permanently, any changes to the mapping would require reprocessing the entire dataset to ensure consistency. To address the case when values in a lookup are expected to change with time, we developed dynamic lookups. Dynamic lookups, also known as Query Time Lookups, are lookups that are retrieved at query time, as opposed to being used at ingestion time.

Benefits of dynamic lookups include:

- Historical continuity for dimensions that change frequently without reprocessing the entire dataset
- Time savings, because there is no dataset reprocessing required to complete the update
- Dynamic lookups are kept separate from the dataset. Thus, any human errors introduced in the lookup do not impact the underlying dataset
- Ability for users to create new dimension tables from metadata associated with a dimension table. For example, account ownership can change during the course of a quarter. In such cases, a dynam
