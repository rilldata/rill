Dimensions are fundamental components of metrics views that enable data segmentation, filtering, and analysis. They represent categorical or descriptive attributes of your data that allow you to break down metrics into meaningful segments.

- [**Unnesting Arrays**](/build/metrics-view/dimensions/unnesting) - Work with array data by expanding nested structures
- [**Lookup Dimensions**](/build/metrics-view/dimensions/lookup) - Create dimensions that reference data from other sources
