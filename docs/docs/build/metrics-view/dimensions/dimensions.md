description: "Learn how to create and configure dimensions for data segmentation, filtering, and analysis in your metrics views"

Dimensions are fundamental components of metrics views that enable data segmentation, filtering, and analysis. They represent categorical or descriptive attributes of your data that allow you to break down measures into meaningful segments.

Dimensions are the "who," "what,", and "where" of your data. They provide context and categorization for your measures, enabling you to:

- **Segment data**: Break down metrics by categories like region, product type, or customer segment
- **Filter analysis**: Focus on specific subsets of your data
- **Enable drill-downs**: Navigate from high-level summaries to detailed breakdowns
- **Create comparisons**: Analyze performance across different groups


Explore these advanced capabilities to enhance your dimensions:

- [**Clickable Dimension URI**](/build/metrics-view/dimensions/dimension-uri) - Generate navigable URIs for your dimension values
- [**Unnesting Arrays**](/build/metrics-view/dimensions/unnesting) - Work with array data by expanding nested structures
- [**Lookup Dimensions**](/build/metrics-view/dimensions/lookup) - Create dimensions that reference data from other sources
