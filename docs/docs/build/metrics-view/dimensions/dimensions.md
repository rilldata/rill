title: "Define Your Dimensions"
---

Dimensions are fundamental components of metrics views that enable data segmentation, filtering, and analysis. They represent categorical or descriptive attributes of your data that allow you to break down metrics into meaningful segments.

See below pages for detailed examples on how to expand the capabilities of dimensions in Rill.

- [**Clickable Dimension URI**](/build/metrics-view/dimensions/dimension-uri) - Generate navigable URIs for your dimension values
- [**Unnesting Arrays**](/build/metrics-view/dimensions/unnesting) - Work with array data by expanding nested structures
- [**Lookup Dimensions**](/build/metrics-view/dimensions/lookup) - Create dimensions that reference data from other sources
