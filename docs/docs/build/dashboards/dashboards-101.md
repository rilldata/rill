Rill offers two distinct dashboard experiences, each optimized for different use cases and user needs. While both are used to visualize your data, the key difference lies in how they handle [**metrics views**](/build/metrics-view) - the data sources that power your dashboards.

- **Explore Dashboards** - Standardized _opinionated_ dashboards with consistent data components, visualizations, and layout structure that promotes slice-and-dice discovery and interactive data exploration that are built over a **single metrics view** using [One Big Table approach.](/build/models/models-101#one-big-table-and-dashboarding)
- **Canvas Dashboards** - Traditional dashboards that allow users to customize visualizations and layout according to their specific requirements utilizing **multiple metrics views**.


## Built on Metrics Views

All dashboards in Rill are built on [metrics views](/build/metrics-view/metrics-view.md). This ensures that your defined measures and dimensions are standard throughout all of your visualizations. 

The primary difference between Explore and Canvas dashboards is that:
-  **Explore Dashboards is built on a single metrics view**
-  **Canvas Dashboards can combine multiple metrics views** in one dashboard.


## Explore Dashboards

**[Explore dashboards](/build/dashboards/explore)** are designed for interactive data exploration and analysis. They provide a powerful "slice and dice" experience focused on a single metrics view. Some key features of our Explore Dashboards include:

- [Pivot Tables](/explore/dashboard-101/pivot)
- [Time Dimension Detail](/explore/dashboard-101/tdd)
- [Leaderboards](/explore/dashboard-101/multi-metrics)
