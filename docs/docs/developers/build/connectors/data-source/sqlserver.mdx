## Overview

[Microsoft SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/) is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It supports a wide range of applications, from small projects to large enterprise systems, with features like advanced analytics, in-memory processing, and robust security. You can connect to and read from SQL Server databases directly.

## Authentication Methods

To connect to SQL Server, you need to provide database connection credentials. Rill supports connecting via individual parameters (host, port, user, password, database).

<TwoStepFlowIntro
  connector="SQL Server"
  step1Description="Set up your SQL Server connector with connection credentials (host, port, user, password, database)"
  step2Description="Define which table or query to execute"

### Connection String Format

When connecting to SQL Server, you can also specify a Data Source Name (DSN) using the following syntax:

```bash
mssql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>
```

- **scheme**: Use `mssql` for SQL Server connections.
- **user** and **password**: Should correspond to the user credentials that Rill will use to connect to SQL Server.
- **host** and **port**: Should correspond to the hostname and port (default 1433) of your SQL Server instance.
- **database**: Should correspond to the database in SQL Server that you are using.

For special characters in the password, percent-encode them (e.g., `@` becomes `%40`, `:` becomes `%3A`):
```text
mssql://user:pa%40ss@localhost:1433/my-db   # password contains '@'
mssql://user:pa%3Ass@localhost:1433/my-db   # password contains ':'
```

For more details, see the [go-mssqldb connection string documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/go-mssqldb#connection-parameters-and-dsn).

## Method 1: Connection Credentials

### Using the UI

1. Click **Add Data** in your Rill project
2. Select **SQL Server** as the data source type
3. In the authentication step:
   - Enter your SQL Server host and port
   - Enter your database name
   - Enter your username and password
   - Configure encryption if needed
4. In the data model configuration step, enter your SQL query
5. Click **Create** to finalize

After the model YAML is generated, you can add additional [model settings](/developers/build/models/source-models) directly to the file.

### Manual Configuration

If you prefer to configure manually:

**Step 1: Create connector configuration**

Create `connectors/sqlserver.yaml`:

```yaml
type: connector
driver: sqlserver

host: "localhost"
port: 1433
database: "mydatabase"
user: "myusername"
password: "{{ .env.SQLSERVER_PASSWORD }}"
encrypt: false
```

**Step 2: Add credentials to `.env`**

```bash
SQLSERVER_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
```

<EnvPullTip />

Then, [create your first model](#create-your-first-model).

## Method 2: DSN Connection String

You can also configure the connector using a single DSN connection string instead of individual parameters.

Create `connectors/sqlserver.yaml`:

```yaml
type: connector
driver: sqlserver

dsn: "{{ .env.SQLSERVER_DSN }}"
```

Add the DSN to your `.env` file:

```bash
SQLSERVER_DSN=mssql://myusername:mypassword@localhost:1433/mydatabase
```

<EnvPullTip />

Then, [create your first model](#create-your-first-model).

## Create Your First Model

Once your connector is configured, create a model to define what data to pull.

Create `models/sqlserver_data.yaml`:

```yaml
type: model
connector: sqlserver
dev:
  sql: SELECT TOP 10000 * FROM my_table

sql: SELECT * FROM my_table
```

After creating the model, you can add additional [model settings](/developers/build/models/source-models) directly to the file.
