## Overview

[MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/introduction.html) is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its reliability, performance, and ease of use. It is widely used for a variety of applications, from small to large enterprise projects, supporting structured data storage, retrieval, and management with SQL queries. MySQL offers a comprehensive ecosystem with support for advanced features such as replication, transactions, and full-text indexing, making it a versatile choice for integrating with BI tools. You can connect to and read from MySQL databases directly.

## Connection String Format

When connecting to MySQL, you need to specify an appropriate Data Source Name (DSN) using the following syntax:

```bash
<scheme>://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>
```

- **scheme**: The transport protocol to use. Use `mysql` for classic MySQL protocol connections and `mysqlx` for X Protocol connections.
- **user** and **password**: Should correspond to the user credentials that Rill will use to connect to MySQL.
- **host** and **port**: Should correspond to the IP address/hostname and port (default 3306) of your MySQL database.
- **database**: Should correspond to the database in MySQL that you are using.

For more details, see the [MySQL documentation on DSN formats](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.html#connecting-using-uri).

## Using the Add Data UI

<TwoStepFlowIntro
  connector="MySQL"
  step1Description="Set up your MySQL connector with connection credentials (host, port, user, password, database)"
  step2Description="Define which table or query to execute"
/>

## Connect to MySQL

### Using the UI

1. Click **Add Data** in your Rill project
2. Select **MySQL** as the data source type
3. In the authentication step:
   - Enter your MySQL host and port
   - Enter your database name
   - Enter your username and password
   - Configure SSL mode if needed
4. In the data model configuration step, enter your SQL query
5. Click **Create** to finalize

After the model YAML is generated, you can add additional [model settings](/developers/build/models/source-models) directly to the file.

### Manual Configuration

If you prefer to configure manually, create two files:

**Step 1: Create connector configuration**

Create `connectors/my_mysql.yaml`:

```yaml
type: connector
driver: mysql

host: "localhost"
port: 3306
database: "mydatabase"
user: "myusername"
password: "{{ .env.connector.mysql.password }}"
ssl_mode: "DISABLED"
```

**Step 2: Create model configuration**

Create `models/my_mysql_data.yaml`:

```yaml
type: model
connector: my_mysql

sql: SELECT * FROM my_table

# Add a refresh schedule
refresh:
  cron: "0 */6 * * *"
```

**Step 3: Add credentials to `.env`**

```bash
connector.mysql.password=your-secure-password
```
