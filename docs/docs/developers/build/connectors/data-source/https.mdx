## Overview

The HTTPS connector allows you to import data from remote sources accessible via HTTP or HTTPS URLs into your Rill project. This includes publicly accessible files hosted on web servers, CDNs, or cloud storage services—perfect for working with datasets that are regularly updated or shared publicly.

## Authentication Methods

To connect to data via HTTPS, you need to choose an authentication approach. Rill supports two methods:

1. **Use Authenticated Endpoints** (for private APIs or protected resources)
2. **Use Public URLs** (for publicly accessible files without authentication)

:::tip Authentication Methods
Choose the method that matches your data source requirements. For protected resources that require API keys or tokens, use authenticated endpoints. For publicly accessible files, you can use public URLs directly.

## Method 1: Authenticated Endpoints (Recommended for Protected Resources)

If your endpoint requires authentication, create an HTTPS connector with your credentials. This method works for both local development and Rill Cloud deployments.

### Using the UI

1. Click **Add Data** in your Rill project
2. Select **HTTPS** as the data source type
3. In the authentication step:
   - Configure authentication headers (e.g., Bearer token)
4. In the data model configuration step, enter the full URL to your data
5. Click **Create** to finalize

After the model YAML is generated, you can add additional [model settings](/developers/build/models/source-models) directly to the file.

### Manual Configuration

If you prefer to configure manually, create two files:

**Step 1: Create connector configuration**

Create `connectors/my_https.yaml`:

```yaml
type: connector
driver: https

headers:
  Authorization: "Bearer {{ .env.connector.https.token }}"
```

**Step 2: Create model configuration**

Create `models/my_https_data.yaml`:

```yaml
type: model
connector: my_https

path: https://api.endpoint.com/v1/data/export.csv

# Add a refresh schedule
refresh:
  cron: "0 */6 * * *"
```

**Step 3: Add credentials to `.env`**

```bash
connector.https.token=your_api_token_here
```

## Method 2: Public URLs

For publicly accessible files that don't require authentication, you can use the HTTPS connector directly without credentials.

### Using the UI

1. Click **Add Data** in your Rill project
2. Select **HTTPS** as the data source type
3. In the authentication step, skip or leave authentication blank
4. In the data model configuration step, enter the full public URL
5. Click **Create** to finalize

### Manual Configuration

**Step 1: Create connector configuration (optional)**

For public URLs, you can create a simple connector or use the built-in `https` connector:

Create `connectors/public_https.yaml`:

```yaml
type: connector
driver: https
```

**Step 2: Create model configuration**

Create `models/my_public_data.yaml`:

```yaml
type: model
connector: https

path: https://example.com/data.csv

# Add a refresh schedule
refresh:
  cron: "0 */6 * * *"
```

## Supported URL Types

The HTTPS connector supports various remote data sources:

- **Public HTTP/HTTPS URLs**: Direct links to CSV, JSON, Parquet, and other data files
- **Cloud Storage URLs**: Public links to files in Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, or other cloud providers
- **API Endpoints**: REST APIs that return data in supported formats

## Deploy to Rill Cloud

<DeployToCloud
  connector="HTTPS"
  connectorId="https"
  credentialDescription="authentication credentials for protected HTTPS endpoints"
/>

## Best Practices

- **Use HTTPS URLs**: Prefer secure HTTPS connections over HTTP when possible
- **Check File Accessibility**: Ensure your URLs are publicly accessible or properly authenticated
- **Monitor File Size**: Large files may take longer to download and process
- **Regular Updates**: Set up automated refreshes for frequently updated datasets
