Metrics Views are a key part of defining your measures and dimensions. 

### Metrics 101
- [**What are Metrics Views?**](/developers/build/metrics-view/what-are-metrics-views) - Define your time series, measures, and dimensions using your OLAP engine aggregate functions
- [**Underlying Model/Table**](/developers/build/metrics-view/underlying-model) - When to use `model` or `table` in a metrics view
- [**Time Series**](/developers/build/metrics-view/time-series) - What is a time series column and how to use it in your metrics view

### Dimensions
- [**Dimensions**](/developers/build/metrics-view/dimensions) - Categorize and segment your data for analysis and filtering
- [**Navigatable Dimensions**](/developers/build/metrics-view/dimensions/dimension-uri) - Generate navigable URIs for your dimension values
- [**Unnesting Arrays**](/developers/build/metrics-view/dimensions/unnesting) - Work with array data by expanding nested structures
- [**Time Dimensions**](/developers/build/metrics-view/dimensions/time-dimensions) - Add multiple time-based dimensions for filtering across different date columns
- [**Lookup Dimensions**](/developers/build/metrics-view/dimensions/lookup) - Create dimensions that reference data from other sources

### Measures
- [**Measures**](/developers/build/metrics-view/measures) - Define calculated metrics and aggregations for your data analysis
- [**Format Measures**](/developers/build/metrics-view/measures/measures-formatting) - Learn how to format and display your metrics effectively
- [**Case Statements and Filters**](/developers/build/metrics-view/measures/case-statements) - Use conditional logic and filtering in your measures
- [**Referencing Measures**](/developers/build/metrics-view/measures/referencing) - Reference and combine existing measures in your calculations
- [**Quantiles**](/developers/build/metrics-view/measures/quantiles) - Calculate percentiles and quantiles for statistical analysis
- [**Fixed Measures**](/developers/build/metrics-view/measures/fixed-measures) - Create measures with fixed values and constants
- [**Window Functions**](/developers/build/metrics-view/measures/windows) - Apply window functions for advanced analytical operations

### Security 
- [**Data Access Policies**](/developers/build/metrics-view/security) - Control access to your metrics data with role-based permissions
