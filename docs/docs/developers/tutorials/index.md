# Welcome to Rill Tutorials!

### We're thrilled you've joined us on this th-Rill-ing journey!

These tutorials were built to help you get started with Rill and empower you to build your own projects. The journey covers data import, SQL transformations, dashboard creation, and finally deployment to Cloud. From there, you'll explore Rill Cloud-specific features, push local changes to Rill Cloud, and develop custom features.

### Why Rill?
Here at Rill, we believe in business-speed visual analytics. Gone are the days of waiting for your dashboard to load! By utilizing OLAP engines, we strive for quick, reactive dashboards that you can drill down into further to make real-time decisions. Not only that, you'll also be able to make traditional dashboards that we call Canvas Dashboards.
