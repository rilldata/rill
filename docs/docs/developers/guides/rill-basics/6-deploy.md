:::tip Rill Cloud Trial

If this is the first time you have deployed a project onto Rill Cloud, you will automatically start your [Rill Cloud Trial](/other/plans#trial-plan) upon deployment of your Rill project. Your trial will last for 30 days. Please refer to our documentation for more information on the details of your trial.

## Deploy via the UI!


Depending on your version, you'll notice a `Deploy to share` button in the top right corner. Let's select it!
:::note Don't see the button?
Deploying via the UI was introduced in v0.48. Please upgrade Rill by running `rill upgrade` in the CLI. The version is on the bottom left of the Rill Developer UI.
