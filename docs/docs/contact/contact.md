Rill has a globally distributed team and we'd love to hear from you—whether you're a customer, prospect, or simply a Rill enthusiast. There are several ways to get in touch with the Rill team and engage with the community, which are described below.

## GitHub

Rill is part of the open source community, and you can find the source code of our Rill Developer project on GitHub [here](https://github.com/rilldata/rill). We welcome contributions, but if you simply want to report a bug, file an issue, or request a feature, you can do so on [this page](https://github.com/rilldata/rill/issues).

## Discord

Curious to see if someone else has encountered an issue before, looking for help getting started, interested in tapping into the collective knowledge of others, or simply want to engage with other members of the Rill community? Rill's community can be found on Discord, and we'd love for you to be a part of it! Please click [here](https://discord.gg/2ubRfjC7Rh) to access our dedicated Discord channel.

## Contacting Support
If you'd like to get in contact with the Rill team directly and/or contact Rill Support, there are a few different options available.

### Slack channel

If you're an active prospect or customer, you will have access to a dedicated Slack channel with the Rill team. This ensures we can provide you with individualized responses to your questions or issues, with the fastest response times from our distributed team.
