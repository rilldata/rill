## Rill access for managed pipelines

In addition to standard connectors, Rill also manages data pipelines for customers or sets up orchestration for moving data from object stores/data warehouses into Rill's managed database service. Rill's dedicated data engineering services help build out everything from basic orchestration to complete data enrichment and custom data pipelines.

To provide access for the Rill team, your team can grant read access: 

- [Amazon s3](/other/granting/aws-s3-bucket)
- [GCS](/other/granting/gcs-bucket)
- [Google BigQuery](/other/granting/google-bigquery)
- [Microsoft Azure Storage](/other/granting/azure-storage-container)
