## Developer guidelines

We keep all information about developing and testing Rill in our monorepo at [github.com/rilldata/rill-developer](http://github.com/rilldata/rill-developer/). See the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/rilldata/rill-developer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file as an entrypoint.

## Community guidelines

Our goal is to foster a community that can grow in our data practice and build new tools that break the mold on what people think is possible today. Trust and safety is critical in building a strong community where we can share ideas and ask questions. This is impossible if people feel threatened, harassed or discriminated against.

To this end, all Rill Data Community members are asked to read and adhere to our [community policy](https://github.com/rilldata/rill-developer/blob/main/COMMUNITY-POLICY.md) so we have a shared understanding of the kind of courtesy we want to show each other. These guidelines will be enforced by Rill Data Community Administrators and Leaders.
