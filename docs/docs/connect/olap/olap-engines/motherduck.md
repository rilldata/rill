## Overview
<img src='/img/reference/olap-engines/motherduck/rill-developer.png' class='rounded-gif' />
<br />


[MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/) is a cloud-native DuckDB service that provides scalable analytics and data processing capabilities. Built on the same core engine as DuckDB, MotherDuck offers the familiar SQL interface and performance characteristics while adding cloud-native features like serverless compute, automatic scaling, and collaborative data sharing.

Rill supports connecting to MotherDuck and using it as an OLAP engine to power dashboards. This is particularly useful when you want the performance and SQL compatibility of DuckDB with the scalability and collaboration features of a cloud service.

:::note Supported Versions
Rill supports connecting to MotherDuck using the latest DuckDB-compatible drivers and protocols.

## Configuring Rill Developer with MotherDuck

When using MotherDuck for local development, you can connect using your MotherDuck access token. The connection is established through MotherDuck's secure API endpoints.

1. Connect to MotherDuck via Add Data. This will automatically create the `motherduck.yaml` file in your `connectors` folder and populate the `.env` file with `motherduck_token`.

```yaml
# Connector YAML
# Reference documentation: https://docs.rilldata.com/reference/project-files/connectors

type: connector                                  # Must be `connector` (required)
driver: duckdb                                   # Must be `duckdb` _(required)_


path: "md:my_db"                                # Path to your MD database

init_sql: |                                     # SQL executed during database initialization.
  INSTALL 'motherduck';                         -- Install motherduck extension
  LOAD 'motherduck';                            -- Load the extensions
  SET motherduck_token= '{{ .env.motherduck_token }}' -- Define the motherduck token
```

2. You can create/edit the `.env` file manually in the project directory and add your MotherDuck access token.
3. If this project `motherduck_token` as a variable to `rill start` directly (e.g., `rill start --env motherduck_tokenn=...`).

:::tip Getting connection errors after setting `.env`?

If you are facing issues related to connection errors in your dashboards even after setting the token via the project's `.env` file, try restarting Rill using the `rill start --reset` command.

## Getting Your MotherDuck Access Token

<img src='/img/reference/olap-engines/motherduck/service-token.png' class='rounded-gif' />
<br />


To connect to MotherDuck, you'll need a access token from your MotherDuck account:

1. Log in to your [MotherDuck account](https://motherduck.com/)
2. Navigate to the **Settings** section
3. Go to **Access Tokens**
4. Create a new access token or copy an existing one
5. Use this token as the value for `motherduck_token` in your `.env` file

:::warning Keep Your Token Secure

Your MotherDuck access token provides access to your data. Keep it secure and never commit it directly to version control. Always use environment variables or secure credential management.

:::

## Connection Configuration

MotherDuck connections are established through secure API endpoints. The connection is automatically configured when you provide your access token:

```bash
motherduck_token="your_motherduck_service_token_here"
```

:::info MotherDuck Features

MotherDuck provides several advantages over local DuckDB:
- **Serverless compute** - No need to manage infrastructure
- **Automatic scaling** - Handles varying workloads automatically
- **Collaborative data sharing** - Share data and queries with team members
- **Built-in data lake integration** - Connect to S3, GCS, and other cloud storage
- **Web-based interface** - Query and explore data through the MotherDuck console
:::

## Configuring Rill Cloud

When deploying a MotherDuck-backed project to Rill Cloud, you have the following options to pass the appropriate access token:

1. If you have followed the UI to create your MotherDuck connector, the token should already exist in the `.env` file. During the deployment process, this `.env` file is automatically pushed with the deployment.

2. If `motherduck_token` has already been set in your project `.env`, you can push and update these variables directly in your cloud deployment by using the `rill env push` command.

3. If you manually passed the connector when running `rill start`, you will need to use the `rill env configure` command to set `motherduck_token` onto Rill Cloud as well.

:::info
Note that you must `cd` into the Git repository that your project was deployed from before running `rill env configure`.
:::

## Setting the Default OLAP Connection

Creating a connection to MotherDuck will automatically add the `olap_connector` property in your project's [rill.yaml](/reference/project-files/rill-yaml) and change the default OLAP engine to MotherDuck.

```yaml
olap_connector: motherduck
```

:::info Interested in using multiple OLAP engines in the same project?

Please see our [Using Multiple OLAP Engines](/connect/olap/multiple-olap) page.

:::

## Reading from Multiple Databases

Rill supports reading from multiple databases in MotherDuck from within the same project in Rill Developer. All accessible tables (given the permission set of your access token) should automatically be listed in the lower left-hand tab, which can then be used to [create dashboards](/build/dashboards/).

## Data Sharing and Collaboration

One of the key benefits of MotherDuck is its collaborative features:

- **Shared databases**: Create and share databases with team members
- **Cross-database queries**: Query across multiple databases in a single connection
- **Real-time collaboration**: Multiple users can work with the same data simultaneously
- **Access control**: Manage permissions at the database and table level

## Additional Notes

- MotherDuck uses the same SQL syntax as DuckDB, so all standard DuckDB functions and features are available
- For dashboards powered by MotherDuck, [measure definitions](/build/metrics-view/#measures) should follow standard [DuckDB SQL](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/introduction) syntax
- MotherDuck automatically handles data persistence and backup, so you don't need to worry about data loss
- The service provides built-in monitoring and usage analytics through the MotherDuck console
