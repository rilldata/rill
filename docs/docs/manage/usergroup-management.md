Creating user groups in Rill allows administrators to easily grant permission to multiple projects at different access levels. It is possible to mix and match viewer and administrator permission in a single group and users can be part of multiple groups. However, please keep in mind that the higher permission will be applied.

## Managing User groups Permissions
There are two ways to set up user groups in Rill.

1. Administrator via Rill Cloud (Coming soon!)
2. Administrator via CLI

  rill usergroup [command]

  rename      Rename a group
  edit        Edit a group

  add         Add a group to a project or organization
  set-role    Change a group's role on a project or organization
  remove      Remove a group's role on a project or organization
```

## Creating the User group

You can create a new user group by running the following and following the CLI instructions:

```
rill usergroup create
```
You will be prompted for the new user group name.

### Adding permissions to the group
Next, you will need to add the roles and access to the user group.

```
rill usergroup add --project <project_name>

      --group string     User group
      --org string       Organization (default "Rill_Learn")
      --project string   Project
      --role string      Role of the user group (options: admin, editor, viewer)
```
You will be prompted for the role and the name of the group you are editing. If you want to specify a specific project, please use the --project flag. If no project flag is defined, you will be setting permission on the organization level.

If you have any questions on permission levels, please review the [Roles and Permissions page](roles-permissions.md).

### Add a member to the group

To add a member to the user group, run the following command:
```
rill user add --group <group_name>
```

You will be prompted for the email address for the user.

Once added, you can confirm the user group by running the following command:
```
rill user list --group <group_name>
```


## Reference: Walking through access levels

In the following example, you can see the different levels of access to Rill via the organization, project-specific access, user group and user privileges.

### Key things to note
1. There are **three** kinds of access: organization, project, and group.
2. User groups can _only exist_ within an organization.
    - In the case of adding a user who is not part of the organization to a user group, you will prompted to add them first.
