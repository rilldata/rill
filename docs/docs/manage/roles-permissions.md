Access permissions in Rill Cloud are organized into roles at the organization and project level.

## Role inheritance

Organization and project level roles are managed separately, but are connected in several ways:
1. By default, all organization members (but not guests) are added to new projects through a user group membership with the **viewer** role. You can manually remove this relationship in the project's member settings.
2. If you grant a project level role to someone who is not a member of the parent organization, they will automatically be added to the organization with the **guest** role.
3. Removing an organization member or guest automatically also removes them from all projects in the organization.
4. Organization admins implicitly have admin privileges on all projects in the organization.

## Organization-level permissions

There are four roles available at the organization-level: **Admin**, **Editor**, **Viewer** and **Guest**.
