# Why Rill Cloud?

Business users and data analysts need fast, interactive access to their data—without waiting for IT teams to build custom reports or learning complex SQL. Rill Cloud brings powerful analytics directly to your fingertips, enabling you to explore, analyze, and share insights at the speed of thought.

## What Makes Rill Cloud Different?

### Fast, Interactive Exploration

Rill Cloud dashboards respond instantly, even with millions of rows of data. Slice, dice, and drill down into your metrics without waiting for queries to process. Change filters, compare time periods, and explore dimensions—all in real-time.

### No SQL Required

Ask questions about your data in plain English using [AI Chat](/user-guide/ai/ai-chat). Get instant answers without writing queries or waiting for someone else to build a report. Rill understands your business metrics and provides context-aware insights.

### Self-Service Analytics

Explore your data independently without depending on data teams. Dashboards are pre-configured with the metrics and dimensions that matter to your business, so you can focus on finding insights rather than building queries.

### Easy Sharing and Collaboration

Share specific dashboard views with [bookmarks](/user-guide/dashboards/bookmarks), send [scheduled reports](/user-guide/reports/exports) to your inbox, and set up [alerts](/user-guide/alerts) to stay informed when metrics change. Collaborate with your team on insights without complex permission setups.

## How Rill Cloud Works for You

3. **Share insights** - Create bookmarks and share them with stakeholders
