Rill exposes [custom APIs](/integrate/custom-apis/index.md) you have created with `type: api` as HTTP endpoints 
at `https://api.rilldata.com/v1/organizations/<org-name>/projects/<project-name>/runtime/api/<name of api>`.

## Accessing custom APIs

Custom APIs accept both GET and POST requests to the API endpoint with a bearer token in the `Authorization` header. Parameters can always be passed using query arguments in the URL. For example:

```bash
curl https://api.rilldata.com/v1/organizations/<org-name>/projects/<project-name>/runtime/api/<name of api>[?query-args] \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

For POST requests, if you send the `Content-Type: application/json` header, you can optionally also pass arguments as a JSON object in the request body.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.rilldata.com/v1/organizations/<org-name>/projects/<project-name>/runtime/api/<name of api> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"param1": "value1", "param2": "value2"}'
```

## OpenAPI schema

Rill automatically generates an OpenAPI spec that combines the built-in metrics APIs with your custom API definitions. You can use this OpenAPI spec to generate a typed client for accessing Rill from your programming language of choice. You can download the customized OpenAPI spec with:
```bash
curl https://api.rilldata.com/v1/organizations/<org-name>/projects/<project-name>/runtime/api/openapi \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -o openapi.json
```

## Access tokens

There are three types of access tokens you can use with custom APIs.

### User tokens

These tokens are tied to your personal user and access permissions. They are useful for local scripting and experimentation. Not recommended for production use. 

Use the `rill token issue` CLI command to obtain a personal access token. See the [CLI reference](../reference/cli/token) for details.

### Service tokens

These tokens are tied to your Rill organization and persist even if the creating user is removed. They currently always have admin access to all projects in the organization. Service tokens are recommended for use cases that integrate Rill into production systems (such as scheduled jobs or backend APIs).

Since service tokens have admin permissions, they MUST NOT be embedded directly in your frontend or otherwise shared with end users. See "Ephemeral tokens" below for how to create safe, short-lived access tokens.

Use the `rill service create` CLI command to create a service account and issue a token for it. See the [CLI reference](../reference/cli/service) for details.

:::note
When using security policies with service accounts, the `{{ .user.admin }}` user attribute is `true`, but apart from that, the service account does not have any other user attributes. This means if your security policy uses templating like `{{ .user.email }}`, it must have fallback logic in place for when no `email` is present.

### Ephemeral user tokens

You can use a service token to issue a short-lived, ephemeral access token with arbitrary user attributes. This enables you to create tokens that mimic an end user, even for users who are not signed up for Rill. Unlike service tokens, the access permissions of an ephemeral token are scoped to a specific project and user attributes.

The primary use case for these tokens is to have your backend issue a short-lived token that represents your current user, which your frontend can use to make direct calls to APIs in Rill. This is the same feature that powers Rill's embedded dashboards.

To get an ephemeral user token, you need to use a service token to perform a handshake with Rill's credentials API at `https://api.rilldata.com/v1/organizations/<org-name>/projects/<project-name>/credentials`. For example:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.rilldata.com/v1/organizations/<org-name>/projects/<project-name>/credentials \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <service-account-token>" \
  --data-raw '{ "user_email":"<user-email>" }'
``` 

The API accepts the following parameters:
- `user_email`: Optional user email that the token should represent. The user does not need to exist in Rill.
- `attributes`: Optional raw JSON payload of user attributes. This setting is not compatible with `user_email`. When using this, make sure to explicitly pass all the attributes used in your security policies, like `email` or `domain`.
- `ttl_seconds`: Optional time-to-live for the token. Defaults to 24 hours (86400 seconds).
