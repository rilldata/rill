By default, the Explore dashboard displays a single measure for each dimension in the leaderboard. However, there are many cases where comparing multiple measures side-by-side can provide deeper insights.

## Benefits of Multiple Measure Dashboards

With the **Multiple Measure Leaderboard** feature, you can easily select and compare several measures for any dimension. Simply open the dropdown in the dimension leaderboard, enable `multi-select`, and choose any combination of visible measures to display them together.

### Why Compare Multiple Measures?

Comparing multiple measures at once allows you to:
- **Spot correlations** between different metrics for the same dimension.
- **Quickly identify outliers** or trends that may not be obvious when viewing a single measure.
- **Make more informed decisions** by seeing the full context of your data.
