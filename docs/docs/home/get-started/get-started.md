:::note Rill Developer vs Rill Cloud
Rill Developer is your local development environment where you build and test your analytics projects. Once ready, you can deploy to Rill Cloud for team collaboration and production use. For more details, see our [Developer vs Cloud comparison](/concepts/developerVsCloud.md).

### Step 2: Connect Your Data

Rill supports a wide range of data sources through our [connector library](/connect). For this tutorial, we'll use a sample dataset hosted on Google Cloud Storage.

**What happens when you connect data:**
- Rill automatically detects your data schema
- Provides a preview of the first 150 rows
- Analyzes data types, value ranges, and patterns
- Creates a foundation for your analytics

  position: "relative", 
  width: "100%", 
  paddingTop: "56.25%", 
  borderRadius: "15px",
  boxShadow: "0px 4px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)"
}}>
  <iframe credentialless="true"

    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      borderRadius: "10px", 
    }}
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Step 3: Create Your First Dashboard

Rill's AI-powered dashboard creation makes it easy to go from data to insights in seconds. The system automatically generates relevant visualizations and suggests key metrics based on your data.

<div style={{ 
  position: "relative", 
  width: "100%", 
  paddingTop: "56.25%", 
  borderRadius: "15px",
  boxShadow: "0px 4px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)"
}}>
  <iframe credentialless="true"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_e_IbPKbA6k?si=Jm4jUT5aszL0oNJl"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      borderRadius: "10px", 
    }}
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Step 4: Explore and Analyze

Once your dashboard is created, you can:

- **Navigate different views** - Pivot tables, time-series analysis, and multi-measure charts
- **Drill down into data** - Click on any element to explore deeper insights
- **Customize visualizations** - Adjust charts, filters, and layouts
- **Export insights** - Share findings with your team
