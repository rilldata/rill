## Overview

BI-as-code is a modern approach to business intelligence that treats analytics assets as code, bringing the same benefits of version control, collaboration, and automation that software development teams have enjoyed for years. With Rill, you can define your entire analytics stack—from data models to dashboards—using code, while still maintaining the flexibility to make UI-based adjustments when needed.

## How It Works in Rill

Rill implements BI-as-code through a combination of:

1. **SQL-based Definitions**: Define your models via SQL to connect to your various sources
2. **YAML Configuration**: Configure your metrics views, dashboards, and project settings via YAML
3. **Git Integration**: Version control your analytics assets
4. **CLI Tools**: Deploy and manage your analytics stack from the command line
   
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/concepts/metrics-view/metrics-view-components.png" style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '15px', padding: '20px' }} />
</div>


This approach allows engineering teams to maintain control over their analytics stack while enabling business users to make adjustments through the UI when needed.
