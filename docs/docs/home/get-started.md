## Example Projects Repository

Take a look at our [public repository](https://github.com/rilldata/rill-examples/) for examples on getting started with Rill! 

Each example project includes a README with more details on:

- Source data in the dataset
- Dimension and metric definitions
- Example dashboard analyses

Current projects include:

- [App Engagement](https://github.com/rilldata/rill-examples/tree/main/rill-app-engagement): a conversion dataset used by marketers, mobile developers or product teams to analyze funnel steps
- [Cost Monitoring](https://github.com/rilldata/rill-examples/tree/main/rill-cost-monitoring): based off of Rill's own internal dashboards, cloud infrastructure data (compute, storage, pipeline statistics, etc.) merged with customer data to analyze bottlenecks and look for efficiencies
- [GitHub Analytics](https://github.com/rilldata/rill-examples/tree/main/rill-github-analytics): analyze GitHub activity to understand what parts of your codebase are most active, analyze contributor productivity, and evaluate the intersections between commits and files
- [Programmatic Ads/OpenRTB](https://github.com/rilldata/rill-examples/tree/main/rill-openrtb-prog-ads): bidstream data for programmtic advertisers to optimize pricing strategies, look for inventory opportunities, and improve campaign performance
- [Final Tutorial Project](https://github.com/rilldata/rill-examples/tree/main/my-rill-tutorial): A finalized version of the tutorial project with many working examples, a good place to reference any newer features, updated regularly.

## Installing Examples

You can install `rill` using our installation script:

```
curl https://rill.sh | sh
```

To run an example (in this case our Programmatic/OpenRTB dataset):
```
git clone https://github.com/rilldata/rill-examples.git
cd rill-examples/rill-openrtb-prog-ads
rill start
```

Rill will build your project from data sources to dashboard and then launch in a new browser window.
